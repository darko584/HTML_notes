          <h2>Hey there, traveller!</h2>
          <p>I hope you're enjoying the guides, videos and this website in particular.</p>
          <p>While the website has tens of thousands of visitors each month, which is potentially very profitable if using google ads, I decided to keep the website completely ad-free forever. Yet it cost a bit to keep it maintained, paying for qualitative webhosting services. Hosting package runs out soon - consider to make a little <a href="https://www.patreon.com/SinitarGaming">contribution</a> to its ad-free work. It's absolutely voluntary, but highly appreciated.</p>
          <p>Cheers! :)</p>

      <h3 class="section_name" style="margin-top:-10px;">About this guide:</h3>
      <div class="about_guide_intro">
        <p>This guide is a brother of my Skyrim LE <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/skyrim_graphics.html">graphics</a> and <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/skyrim_gameplay.html">gameplay</a> guides, in a single one - and a result of months of modding Skyrim SE. My goal is a complete guide to save other people time that they can have a complete base list of mods for ultrarealistic graphics and challenging, nextgen gameplay, knowing how much these mods will affect on performance and in what order they should install the mods, which are compatible and which are not, etc. Skyrim have thousand of mods here at Nexus and there's very hard to check them all, but I spent some time and did this - from the 1st till the last page (I'm not joking hehe) of all the mods on Nexus and chosen almost everything you need to transform your game and also to have some variants of similar mods to choose from. List of 1400+ mods (but at the same time "quality about quantity", including different variants to choose from) to install to make your Skyrim graphics look nextgen and gameplay feel on absolutely next level. Installation order, performance notes, patches list and personal recommendations included.</p>
        <p>This guide has both graphics and gameplay parts, two in one. For graphics mods installation, the [installation] order matters the most - so, for the best results, it's humbly recommended to follow the same order as mods are listed. For gameplay guide, installation order doesn't matter, but load order does, so read the mod pages/my own notes if preset carefully. Also you can check the videos at my YT channel to see how game can look when fully-modded. To make guide navigation easier, I placed guide sections into so called "spoilers" - when you see "Show" button - just click on it to expand corresponding group of mods. Click "Hide" again to close it :) Please also note that this guide is still designed for modern rigs - yet, guide also has section for low-end rigs, and many other advises here and there, as well as performance-hungry mods marked - so, you can built and ultimate setup for your own PC, no matter what it strength is.</p>
        <p>But here come another exciting part! Guide also has so called "modules" - a premade mod lists (don't confuse with mod packs please) for different tastes and goals - which you only need to mimic, without worrying about incompatibiities and other issues. Modules will fit perfectly the people who don't have enough of free time to go through whole guide themselves.</p>
        <p>Feel free to suggest any mod you want to see in this list or ask me any compatibility/stability questions I'm running Skyrim SE without any crashes and issues with about 1000 mods installed - and you can have even more and still have your game 100% stable. That's not some kind of exaggeration - everything you need is to follow the guide attentively :)</p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="section_name">Permissions:</h3>
      <p>Do not re-upload this guide to any other website and/or resources, do not claim it as own work and do not sell it. In the rest - feel free to translate into other languages (just message me in Discord first), I'b be glad if you'll link it to help other people and so on. I'm here to serve - the more people can have stable ultramodded game, the happier I will be :)</p>

      <div class="guide_features">
        <ul><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Complete list of graphics and gameplay mods for ultimate nextgen game, 1400+ mods in total.

Not a single texture will remain ugly after you finish this, and all possible gameplay mechanics will be improved, as well as tons of new ones can be added, hell yeah!</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Everything you need yet nothing excess. Not a huge mod list, filled with subjective choices, yet a roadmap showing you how to build your own dream setup. While, if you lack time - there are some mod lists prepared for you, in [addition] to guide itself.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Detailed installation order.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Comfortable and easy-to-navigate design.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Patches list for compatibility and my personal remarks for the best result.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Performance notes.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">List of all basic things/tools/tweaks you need to start modding and have stable game.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">ENB installation guide + tweaks/fixes advices.</font></font></li><li>The biggest problem of heavy-modded games, script overload, didn't go anywhere in SE, unfortunately - game script engine, Papyrus, was not changed and having too many script-heavy mods may break even the most stable game. Worry not! Many script-heavy mods are marked with special <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/SWjYqZD.png" alt=""> mark in the guide, so you'll know in advance which mods you'll need to be careful with.</li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Merging the mods easier then ever before! Mods that can be easily merged in a few click - marked with a special <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""> sign - so you don't need to spend own time checking for many factors. Currently, more than 200 mods are marked already, meaning that's literally more than 200 mods you can merge straight away, and I will expand this gradually.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Separate section for low-end PC owners (which you can still use even if your PC is strong, to have FPS boost).</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Pre-made mod lists for different tastes and goals, which you only need to mimic and don't worry about incompatibilities and other issues - in addition to the whole guide itself.</font></font></li><li><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Constant updates and support :)</font></font></li></ul>

      <h3 class="section_name">How to Support:</h3>
      <p>This project is completely free. Still, it takes insane amount of my time to build and expand it - the modding guides already took me ~3200 working hours in total while they are not monetized in any way. The more independent I will fee myself as an author, the faster new updates and modules will arrive. But support only if you really want it and able to:</p>

        <div class="guide_faq">
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> What are the PC specs needed to run the same modded setup as you do, to have [best] possible graphics and gameplay?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>Not such NASA PC as you may think! Intel i5 6600k or AMD analogue, GTX 980Ti/1070 or AMD analogue, 16GB RAM - with similar specs you'll be be able to run absolutely monstrous setup with everything retextures, all needed lighting/weather/immersion mods, at ultra settings, with any ENB you want, 3D LODs and so on. Yes, this guide is made for ALL rigs - no matter if your PC srong, not that much or a complete potato - you can find recommendations, and build best possible modded game.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> So I should install ALL mods from this list?<br><font color="#3c78d8">A:</font> You technically can ofc, but that's not mandatory. This is a guide - it gives you an ability to compare and choose. Open mod pages, browse the images, read the description. Install what you like and don't install what you don't like :) Lastly, there are pre-made mod lists for you to mimic.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> I have the game in language other than English, is it a problem?<br><font color="#3c78d8">A:</font> The guide is made for original, i.e. English version of the game. Graphics mods will ofc work fine in most of cases, but as for the gameplay mods, there is no guarantee that they will work with non-English version of the game, or work at all. Moreover, many translations are often outdated which leads to various bugs and conflicts. If you want to be able to use Skyrim modding stage and this guide on its fullest, use English version of the game. I won't be able to give any troubleshooting support for non-English versions.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> I also want to install ENB, where's a tips for it?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font> Sure! Whatever you want - it is here ;) Just read a bit further.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> I got infinite loading screen/my game crashes/I have FPS drops while having a modern rig.<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font> Please read "How to start" section&nbsp;carefully. Read it and install all the things needed before starting to install mods themselves.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> That doesn't help!<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font> Trust me, if you have read everything carefully and installed mods carefully, it will solve all your problems in 99% of cases. If not, feel free to join our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/XjyJvxP">Discord server</a>&nbsp;and community members or I will try our best to help you :)<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> Where are you from? A few words about you?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font> Ukraine. Gamer, retarded slavic youtuber, One Piece &amp; JJBA fan, gym addict. Web-developer in past, fitness trainer and nutritionist now (as hobby).<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> Will you expand this guide and add this/that?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font> Sure - I will update and improve it. Unstoppably :)<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font>&nbsp;Ok, guide just received massive update, but how can I see the little new additions?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font> I add mods and fix text errors few times per week. All the mods freshly added to the guide will be marked with red-colored "<font color="#ff0000">==<font color="#ff0000">NEW==</font></font>" sign.<br><br>
           <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font>&nbsp;Wait, why the popular [mod_name] is not here?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:</font>&nbsp;One of the main goals of the guide always was to keep your game stable. There are some absolutely great and popular mods, but the thing is popularity now always equal same great quality and stability. Some mods are not included simply because they have major or too many minor issues and not fitting concept of stable heavy-modded game. Nothing more besides that.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font>&nbsp;Can you just upload your Skyrim folder with all your mods somewhere so I can just download it and not to choose and install mods one by one?<br><font color="#3d85c6">A:</font>&nbsp;Unfortunately, no. The reasons:<br>Firstly - I can't do this as many mods from the list are Nexus-exslusive and mod authors didn't give a permission to re-upload their works somewhere. I respect their work.<br>Secondly - everyone has absolutely different PC specs and different taste, and my setup can be absolutely unplayable for many people from both these aspects.<br>Trust me - when you're making your mod setup by yourself the result will be way better because most of mods are absolutely matter of taste.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font>&nbsp;But there are a lot of modpacks in internet! I saw them! Even Nexus itself should have modpacks soon!<br>
          <font color="#3d85c6">A:</font>&nbsp;Of course. Modpacks are easy to find and get, but it's also one of the main reason of myth about "heavy-modded 100% stable Skyrim isn't possible" exists. For very same reasons, modpacks simply can't run the same good for everyone. In best case, modpacks is very, very subjectively made pick of mods, which will never fit your taste on 100% and almost always filled with arguable and outdated mods. In worst case, it will just break your game eventually. And if you're installing some list of mods via automated tool, even if all the mods are installed in correct order, you still will have to solve a lot of conflicts, merge mods, make bashed/merged patches, setup the MCMs and so on - and that's the point when you'll have no idea what to do, as this mod list was not made by you. From that point, you can either play the game as is, which will lead to glitchy gameplay and eventually a lot of wasted time, or you'll have to go to point zero and learn about all the mod in the modpack yourself, basically, doing what you had to to from the very beginning, but once again, wasting some time. Modpacks are like those ads in internet that are promising you 6-pack in 7 days without diet and training. There's no "magic button" in case of TES or FO games, and it's no matter who made it - random internet person or they are distributed by some popular authors or websites - it doesn't change anything in terms or aspects listed few lines above. Modpacks [can] work for other games with much smaller and simplier modding stages, yet for TES/FO games the only [real] ultimate game, in both graphics and gameplay terms, is the one you've built yourself &lt;3<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:</font> I urgently need a personal assistance! When you'll finally reply?<br><font color="#3d85c6">A:</font>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I'm just physically unable to reply on pms and give a personal support to each and everyone - I'm just a man in flesh, and spending a lot of time into making my YT content, as well as expanding the guides. Read the guide carefully, drop a question in comments section (I'm always trying to answer as soon I have free minute) or join our community Discord and ask for advice there - there are plenty of experienced modder there which most likely can also advise :)<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;That's all cool and everything, but I wanna stay tuned on updates and have modding chatting, something you can offer?<br><font color="#1e84cc"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;Sure! Just join our&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/XjyJvxP">Discord server</a>﻿&nbsp;- the biggest and most experienced Discord modding community.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700"><b>Q:</b></font>&nbsp;I'm a mod author - I've made a cool mod and it's still not in your guide!<br><font color="#1e84cc"><b>A:</b></font>&nbsp;Just ping me in our Discord server and tell me a few words about your mod - thank you :)

      <div class="image_top_name" style="margin-bottom: -10px;">Now, the first and most important rule. No exceptions:</div>

        <p>Before before you'll start modding. Disable Steam overlay, Afterburner overlay, add Skyrim to your antivirus/firewall "white list". Disable all possible overlays, "boosters", "tuners" programs you may be using in general. All of them can and most likely will screw up your modded game and/or it's many settings. Follow the guide slowly withou a rush. If it's written here to limit your fps using enblocal fps limiter - do it, and don't use and third-party software for it, and so on. You got the idea. Also, it's heavily recommended to disable game autoupdates in Steam.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">1) Download and install mod manager.</span>
          Choose between <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/Nexus-Mod-Manager/releases">Nexus Mod Manager</a>﻿ (use the .exe file) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194">Mod Organizer 2</a>﻿. Both are awesome. I personally use NMM. What's the difference? NMM is "simple yet effective". MO is "mod manager on steroids" packed with tons of cool features. Almost all mods can (and should) be installed via mod manager. Do not install mods manually. The guide contains notices regarding some exceptional cases when you'll need to install some mod/part of mod manually, but for the 99.9% of cases - always use mod manager.<br><br>
          <span class="note_pink">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> Nexus Mods team is currently developing new mod manager called Vortex. It's looking pretty fancy visually, but sadly, it's still very glitchy and pretty dysfunctional. I won't be able to provide any troubleshooting support if you're using it as it's not suitable for modding games like TES or FO. My advice atm is, if really want to, track it and test it by modding some other games with much simplier modding stages. Do not use Vortex to mod Skyrim. Once again, <span class="note_red">DO NOT USE VORTEX TO MOD SKYRIM</span>. If it will be fine one day, I'll let you guys know.

          <span class="step_title">2) Download and install <a href="https://skse.silverlock.org/">SKSE</a>. If you allready have it - great. If no - install it. It's obligatory.</span>
          SKSE is [essential]. Stability mods are also working through it, as well as vastly majority of amazing gameplay mods. Consider it a basic invisible evolution element of Skyrim.<br>
          Download the SE version as marked <a href="https://i.imgur.com/y5TQUVi.png">here</a>. Download the archive somewhere, unpack it. From the folder, get the .dll, .exe files and \Data folder, and place them to your Skyrim SE folder, as showed <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Qc9LHKq.png">here</a>. MO users should archive the \Data folder and install it as any other mod trough MO (you can do the same in NMM as well if you wanna). From now on, launch your game only via SKSE (skse64_loader.exe), not the game regular launcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">3) Download and install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604">SkyUI</a>.</span>
          As mod itself, SkyUI is basically a "PCfication" of ugly vanilla Skyrim interface. On practice, it's also required by most of well-known mods in addition to SKSE. Also install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20406">fix</a> for it.<br>
          Optionally (but very recommended as it's just looks so much more alive and beautiful) install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22938">animated icons</a> mod for it. Also optionally, install this "wider" <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22825">addon</a> for MCM look. Also install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12440">iHUD</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">4) Download and install <a href="https://loot.github.io/">LOOT</a>.</span>
          Get the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wQtmwoI.png">.exe</a> version and just run it.<br>
          LOOT is a must-have tool if you planning to have many mods. It's very easy to install and use.<br>
Its most basic and important function is mod sorting. Many mods should be loaded in strict load order to work properly together. This mod should be loaded before that mod, but after that, and so on. LOOT makes miracles! You can automatically sort all your mods properly by just clicking button 2 times. Sometimes (it happens rare, so mostly you won't to think about it) some mods have direct instructions about how they should be loaded, in this case it's also easy to sort them manually using it. Also, LOOT shows you all you need to know about your mods instlalled - errors, missing records etc. In many cases, if something is not right - it will let you know and it will advise you. Actually, you'll not need to read and lean more than this to use it, but if something is unclear or you want to look at very in-depth guide, check this awesome <a href="https://youtu.be/SzoyWugzZAw">Gopher's video</a>. Use LOOT sorting each time after you've installed a few mods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">5) Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10547">SSE Fixes</a>.</span>
          Install the main file with mod manager (make sure you have chosen the correct version - there are two, for regular SE and VR).<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> don't forget to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10546">DLL Plugin Loader</a> - it's [required]. It should be installed [manually]. Download it, unpack anywhere you want. Then, go to your Skyrim SE root directory (where the game .exe file is) and rename "binkw64.dll" to "binkw64_.dll", for example - in this way, you're backing up the original file. Now, put the "binkw64.dll" file from downloaded archive into the Skyrim SE root folder. Good job!<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #2:</span> if you're on Skyrim SE version 1.5.80, dont use this mod and only use the next one (until this one is updated for 1.5.80). If you're on Skyrim SE version 1.5.73, use both.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">6) Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230">SSE Engine Fixes</a>.</span>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> mods has TWO parts - first main file, the "Part 1" you can install with mod manager. Second, "Part 2", you should download manually, unpack and place all 3 .dll files to your Skyrim root folder (same as in previous step for DDL Plugin Loader).<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #2:</span> you can also download my personal .ini file for this mod with a few small changes for more comfortable gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">7) Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164">SSEEdit</a>.</span>
          It's an awesome tool for cleaning your mods, making changes to mod records (like balancing various values up to your taste, deleting conflicting and/or unneeded objects and so on) and more.<br>Mods may contain "dirty" records and some other issues. And when you will have hundreds of mods, that could be a problem and potentially cause crashes. Clean all mods that have dirty records (until it's directly written by mod author to not do that for some reasons) and all Skyrim's DLCs (which have [hundreds] of dirty records. Yeah - Betheshda didn't even bother to do this for the game "remaster"). Don't be afraid of it, it's not so hard to use as it may look. Check this one awesome general <a href="https://youtu.be/dEuyk-jy-n4">video</a> tutorial and this <a href="https://youtu.be/L6T4rKRAgwo">cleaning tutorial</a>. Also there are a lot of info and videos at it's Nexus page.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> Make double sure to clean all base game master files (Update.esm and all 3 DLC .esm plugins) - otherwise you'll experience random crashes.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #2:</span> MO2 users can try to download and use <a href="https://github.com/z-edit/zedit/releases">zEdit</a> instead. zEdit is like a successor to xEdit - but please take into account though that it's still a WIP (work in progress) project. If you're a newbie modder - better just stick to xEdit (SSEEdit) now as it's absolutely fine. zEdit may provide better functionality than xEdit, but it's still not fully stable and there are not as much video tutorials for its usage as for xEdit. It doesn't mean it's bad - quite the opposite, but until it's officially and fully released, I won't be able to provide troubleshooting support for it - so use it at your own wish. Here's a basic documentary and description of it <a href="https://z-edit.github.io/#/docs?t=Overview">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">8) Install <a href="https://github.com/Wrye-Code-Collection/wrye-bash/releases/tag/307.201904161810">Wrye Bash</a>.</span>
          Scroll down and download the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RvBw2pA.png">.exe</a> version and intall it. The link now is temporary, as it's the newest release that fixes some bugs - so track the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6837">WB page</a> itself from time to time to see if the newer version is uploaded at the mod page.<br>
          Amazing and essential tool to achieve maximum possible compatibility between all your mods.<br>
          We will use it later in our journey, so just grab it for now. I'll explain it later in the guide :)<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> if you'll be noticing you're clearly going above 255 active .esp plugins limit somewhere still in process of adding more and more mods - refer to step #1 in "actions to be made in the end" section at the deep bottom of the guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">9) Download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69905">Merge Plugins</a>.</span>
          Yes, it's hosted in Skyrim LE sections and yes, it does work with SE absolutely fine :) You will need this if you'll make really heavy load order and reach the 255 plugins (.esp) limit. This amazing tool can technically allow you to have almost endless amounts of mods intalled, so you will be limited only by your PC specs and mods themselves (meaning no using broken/dangerous mods and not overloading your game with script-heavy mods). It easily merges plugins into one .esp file, drastically decreasing the total amount of plugins and allowing you to install more and more mods. For A to Z simple tutorial about using it, watch this amazing <a href="https://youtu.be/0S6cpCwTezE">video</a> and follow the steps.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> But what about .esl'fying the mods? It's a new cool feature, so maybe we don't need to merge mods at all anymore? There is a bit more about that - indeed, marking plugins as .esl is a new alternative way of not reaching the 255 plugins limit, but: 1) not all the same mods you can merge can be esl'fied, so sooner or later, you'll eventually need to merge mods anyway 2) esl plugins have some spesific bugs - you can avoid them, but this will mean spending additional time 3) Some other mods, especially mods with dynamic patchers (like ASIS) often simply don't recognize .esl plugins <br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #2:</span> MO2 users, once again, can use zMerge which is inbuilt into zEdit, instead of Merge Plugins. You can also watch this tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/1GdoKbDfleg">video</a>.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note #3</span> if you'll be noticing you're clearly going above 255 active .esp plugins limit ever after making Bashed Patch somewhere still in process of adding more and more mods - refer to step #2 in "actions to be made in the end" section at the deep bottom of the guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">10) Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272">Alternate Start - Live Another Life</a> (additional start options addon available <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4939">here</a>), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962">Skyrim Unbound Reborn</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8328">RASR - Random Alternate Start Reborn</a></span>
          Why you need this? These mods provide wide amount of alternative starts the game for those who do not wish to go through the lengthy intro sequence at Helgen. The thing is that vanilla start (scene in Helgen) is VERY heavy-scripted. And when you will install let's say, 200+mods and start a new game, your Skyrim will be very heavy overloaded. And there's very high chance that your came will crash (because the Papyrus, Skyrim's script engine, was [not] updated in SE and it's same clunky and limited), even if the game itself is absolutely stable. And now these mods save the day! You can just skip this heavy-scripted scene and start anywhere you like. Besides, it has a really wide amount of alternative start, great for roleplay.<br>
          Which one to use, what is the difference? Long story short, ASLAL provides more "roleplay-wise" starts - you will appear in a certain cell, depending on your start option choice, and also has plenty of additional start options addons. Unbound will spawn you randomly, so less "immersive" start, but it allows you highly adjustable character customization (gear, spells etc) which ASLAL doesn't, and the most important - it allows you to play as NON-Dragonborn (but you can "become" it in MCM anytime), which is really a great option. RASR is somewhat like a mix of these two, a really underrated gem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="step_title">11) Get the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4089">SSE NIF Optimizer</a></span>
          This step is optional. Easy-to-use tool to convert meshes from LE to SE. Skyrim SE has MUCH less coverage in terms of remodels/retextures, and while you can mostly use textures from LE ins SE withou issues, the meshes you need to convert. This tool will help you.

        <font size="4"><b class="step_title">Before you start, download this little software:</b></font><font size="4"><a href="http://ddsviewer.com/">DDS VIEWER</a></font><br><font size="2">It's a free, small and awesome tool that allows you to open .dds (texture) files just like any other images. Doing this, you can compare same textures from different mods and decide which one to install. It's a must-have tool.<br>P.S. Installer .exe file doesn't contain eny viruses. Just ignore your antivirus.<br>P.P.S. If you have problems with it on Windows 10 and you're NVIDIA user, try <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/object/windows_texture_viewer.html">this</a>.<br>P.P.P.S. If you're happy Photoshop owner, simply install <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop">this plugin instead</a> and enjoy.</font><br><font color="#ff7700"><br></font><font color="#ff7700"><font size="4"><b>Important tip #1:</b></font></font> During the installation process, overwrite all the files when you will be notified about this. There will be a few cases when you not need to overwrite some files or you need to install texture partially/manually, but I will notify about it.&nbsp;<br><br><font color="#ff7700"><font size="4"><b>Important tip #2:</b></font></font> To install 200 mods and then launch your game is not a best idea. I personally recommend to do in this way: install a few mods (let's say 5-7 if these mods are big, 20-25 if small), sort them with LOOT, launch your game, check it's stable. Install 5 more and so on.<br><br><font color="#ff7700"><font size="4"><b>Important tip #3:</b></font></font> Don't use the "Vortex" button on top of mod pages to download the mods. This button automatically downloads the main version of the mod and that's it - it may be not the version you need, it may be not the only file you need etc. So make a good habit now - never use this button. Instead, always just go to "Files" tab and see what files are there.<br><br><font color="#ff7700"><font size="4"><b>Important tip #4:</b></font></font> Don't use 4k textures untill you have 4k monitor with huge monitor size itself and you have Titan videocard and you're not aiming for screenarchery (like shotting a bugs or leaves). You won't see any difference between 4k and 2k textures until you come absolutely closely to them. 2k is perfect option for 1920 and even higher (2k) monitors. Using 4k textures you'll just waste tonns of VRAM but won't notice this actually. Using 2k will save tonns of VRAM and you're still having beautiful textures. The only where you can install 4k textures are interior cells (caves/mines etc) as interior use much less VRAM and some underground creature retextures (Dwemer/Falmer) due to the same reasons, as well as personal standalone armors/weapons mods. If your PC is not the strongest, or you just want to save some VRAM for something else - for example, latest ENB effects or 3D LODs from DyndoLOD - simply don't waste your memory on that. Graphics quality will be just fine.<br><br><font color="#ff7700"><b>Q:</b></font> But why "waste" of VRAM?<br><font color="#1e84cc"><b>A:</b></font> It's pretty simple. Texture is basically a square img file. Most of people are used to think that 2k uses x2 more VRAM then 1k, and 4k uses x4 more VRAM then 1k, for example. But as texture img is a square, we will receive a bit different values. 1x1=1. 2x2=4. 4x4=16. So as you can see, 2k textures actually use x4 more VRAM compared to 1k, and 4k use x16 more VRAM, which is absolutely insane.<br><br><font color="#ff7700"><b><font size="5">Let's go!<br></font></b></font>

        <div class="guide_faq">
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:&nbsp;</font>What is ENB? Why I ever need it?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>Ok, listen, young padavan. ENB is a graphical enhancement engine that adds visual affects that are not supported by the game initially, at all. Proper antialiasing, real HDR, qualitative bloom, ambient fog effects, various new shaders, ambient occlusion, complex particle lighting, depth of field and much-much more. ENB is also a PC-only engine - that's why modded Skyrim graphics are looking so superior compared with Skyrim graphics on consoles.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:&nbsp;</font>I have the feeling ENB in SE doesn't look same good as in LE...am I hallucinating?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>You aren't. The thing is, indeed, ENB in Skyrim SE is not able to look the same good as in LE. But wait, SE is 64bit and LE is 32bit, and SE is newer, how come, you may ask. Yeah, but all those facts are not related with ENB possilities, in which SE engine is somewhat limited because of running on DX11, while LE us running on DX9. Long story short, ENB works different on DX11 and has less powers. It doesn't support some features (like objects parallax) and has overally weaker shaders quality in general. Lastly, it often has less customization options. All together, this leads to worse look and much smaller diversity of ENB presets compared to LE. If you are aimed on 101% of modded graphics results, you may want to mod Skyrim LE (which is also literally 100% stable today even heavy-modded) instead, following my existing <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/skyrim_graphics.html">guide</a> which will soon receive a massive 3.0 update.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:&nbsp;</font>How much FPS will ENB eat? How do I know that?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>First of all, you need to understand that ENB is ofc FPS-hungry and as it interracts with objects in game and adds a lot of visual effects, ENB performance will depend on many factors - how much texture mods are installed, what our PC specs are etc. But ENB effects are totally and more than worth their price :) Also, in SE, almost all ENB presets make more or less same FPS hit, so if you can normally run one ENB preset, you most likely will be able to run any preset without issues.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:&nbsp;</font>Why installing ENB before the graphics mods? Texture mods are most important, no?<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>No. The thing is, as already mentioned, ENB adds completely new shaders and visual effects to the game - that's why it's the most important part of graphics transformation. A game with good ENB preset and no texture mods at all will always look better than game with even 200 texture mods but no ENB. ENB preset is very much determining the visual style your game will have - so first, it's better to decided which ENB preset you like the most and get it, and then tune your game with retexturing and other mods.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:&nbsp;</font>But what about weather/lighting mods? ENB preset I want to use requires that weather mod!<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>Don't worry. You can install weather/lighting mods required anytime. Weather/lighting "incompatibility" with ENB will not cause crashes, it's just about how the ENB colors and other effects are looking the best possible exactly with required weather/ligting mods.<br><br>
          <font color="#ff7700">Q:&nbsp;</font>My PC/laptop is pretty weak and ENB gives me really low FPS!<br><font color="#1e84cc">A:&nbsp;</font>Rrefer to the end of the guide where I prepared a section especially for low-end PCs - most likely it will allow you to use ENB even if your PC is pretty weak (up to some extent, ofc).<br><br>

        <h3 class="section_name section_name_smol text-center">Before installing the ENB, make a few tweaks/installations for ENB to work and look 100% properly:</h3>
        <ul class="line_list">
          <li>Disable ingame DOF (depth of field) like it's shown <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4XSOmeV.png">here</a>.</li>
          <li>In Skyrim SE launcher settings, disable Ambient Occlusion.</li>
          <li>In Skyrim SE launcher settings disable the improved snow options, or in SkyrimPrefs.ini, set <span class="color_blue">bEnableImprovedSnow=</span> value to 0.</li>
          <li>In SkyrimPrefs.ini, make sure <span class="color_blue">bDrawLandShadows=</span> and <span class="color_blue">bTreesReceiveShadows=</span> values are set to 1.</li>
          <li>In SkyrimPrefs.ini, make sure <span class="color_blue">fGamma=</span> value is set to 1.0000.</li>
          <li>Install <a href="https://mega.nz/#!vpNFFawJ!aqjydQJ_08uRRzXRdK8cJwg55RwXXK2hV_uT7xagzNM">particle patch</a> for ENB. Download the archive, add it to your mod manager and install as any other mod.</li>
          <li>Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18350">Smooth Sky Mesh</a>.</li>
          <li>Now, install the ENB binaries (core files) themselves: go <a href="http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm">here</a> and download the latest version. Unpack the archive and from \WrapperVersion folder, grab <span class="color_blue underline">d3d11.dll</span>, <span class="color_blue underline">d3dcompiler_46e.dll</span> and <span class="color_blue underline">enblocal.ini</span>, and place them to your Skyrim SE root folder (where game .exe is located). That's it!</li>
          <li>Choose and download the ENB preset you like and drop it's content to the same folder (where Skyrim .exe is). Usually, it's simply the <span class="color_blue underline">\enbseries</span> folder and <span class="color_blue underline">enbseries.ini</span> file. Basically, the process of siwtching between ENB presets is as simple as deleting your current \enbseries folder and enbseries.ini and placing a new ones into Skyrim root directory. That's it.</li>
          <li>Make sure to cap your fps at 59 in <span class="color_blue underline">enblocal.ini</span> (set <span class="color_blue underline">EnableFPSLimit=</span> to true and <span class="color_blue underline">FPSLimit=</span> to 59).</li>
          <li>Antialiasing: there are a few options. First one - use the edge AA from ENB (set EnableEdgeAA=true in enblocal.ini). Second one - don't use ENB AA and use TAA (set in game launcher settings). Third one - use ENB SMAA. Not every ENB preset provides it - usually you can choose it in ENB GUI (like in Rudy ENB, for example). Fourth one - DSR (dynamic super resolution). With DSR enabled, game is rendered in higher resolution than your monitor resolution is and then squeezed to your monitor resolution. The difference between those methods: Edge AA is the most simple and fps-friendly, but the also not perfectly smooth (yet still superior to awful ingame AA). TAA is looking very good, but often causes weird "ghosting" artifacts when moving. SMAA is the best in terms of fps price and quality. DSR is superior to any of them, but the most fps-hungry due to how it works. Try all of them and choose the one most suitable for you. If you have somewhat midrange rig, it's either Edge AA, SMAA or TAA. If you have pretty strong rig and video memory is not a problem for you at all, try DSR for sure.</li>
          <li>Not a tweak itself, bur rather a useful info that not everyone are aware about: DOF (depth of field, "blurred effect/focus") is usually different for each ENB preset - as certain author sees it better in own perspective. Some ENB presets may have "lightweight" gameplay DOF - so only very distant views are blurred. Some may have a very strong "screenarchery" DOF - when everything further then a few feets from your character is blurred. And so on. So often it may happen you find an ENB preset greatly fitting your taste, but with terrible (for your taste) DOF. You can, ofc just disable it in ENB GUI, but there's a better thing - you actually can use [any] DOF with [any] ENB preset! Even more, you can actually even use DOF files between different TES/FO games - for example, I'm using Rudy ENB LE DOF in New Vegas and Oblivion, and so on. So just find ENB preset which DOF you like the most and just take it's DOF files (enbdepthoffield.fx and enbdepthoffield.fx.ini) and drop them into your \enbseries folder. Profit!</li>

          <p>When you'll be browsing the ENB presets for Skyrim SE, you may get the feeling that not all, yet many of them are very similar to each other. Unfortunately, that's how it is - due to different level of ENB support in Skyrim SE, it's not possible to have same visual quality and diversity of ENB presets as in <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/skyrim_graphics.html#LE_ENB">Skyrim LE</a>. Yet, today SE ENB presets look pretty great and so here are some of the most well-made of them, and with different styles as much as it's possible in SE. Let's see some <span class="color_blue">(•̀௰•́ )</span></p>
          <p>Also some shortening for weather/lighting mods you will see below: Vanilla - original game, no weather/lighting mod, Obsidian - Obsidian Weathers and Seasons, COT - Climates of Tamriel, NAT - Natural and Atmospheric Tamriel, Vivid - Vivid Weathers, Aequinoctium - Aequinoctium - Weathers and Seasons, Mythical Ages - Mythical Ages - weathers and lighting overhaul, Rustic - Rustic Weathers and Lighting, Dolomite - Dolomite Weathers - Natural Lighting Vivid Atmospherics II, Surreal - Surreal Lighting -- vibrant and cheerful weathers and lighting, Autumn Skies - Autumn Skies - A Weather and Lighting Mod, Cathedral - Cathedral Weathers and Seasons, ELFX - Enhanced Lights and FX, ELE - Enhanced Lighting for ENB, RLO - Realistic Lighting Overhaul.</p>

            While ENB preset choices is a matter of taste more then anything else - still, there are always some presets that are top-notch in terms of overall quality and balance. And Rudy ENB is one of them - it's my personal favorite for both Skyrim LE and Skyrim SE. It has amazing quality of shaders, a gret balance between fantasy, cinematic and realistic look, great performance. Great lighting, great water look and just absolutely polished approach to ENB tweaking in general - that's all about Rudy's preset. In addition, you can always be sure it's always up-to-date with all newest ENB effects and it's also an absolute champion in terms of compatibility - it has version for almost each weather mod and compatible with all 3 popular lighting mods at the same time. If you are not quite sure about ENB choice now, but wanna start from something really great - seek no more!

        <h3 class="section_name section_name_smol text-center">Now, let's go! To the graphics mods!</h3>
        <div class="center_img no-pad-bot"><img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/MlQasA1.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>Once again, here's a simple "rule" - as the guide's task is to save your time as much as possible, installing and overwriting is very simple - just follow the lists of mods, pick what you like, install and overwrite everything ("yes to all" for NMM and giving bigger priority in MO). Mods are listed in the order which, after endless tests and mixing approaches, will lead to the most balanced and beautiful look. In some separate cases where a selective overwriting will be needed, I'll notify you :)</p>
        <p>Also, as Skyrim SE itself requires at least somewhat decent rig to run it without issues, the overall performance impact scatter of graphics mods is different from Skyrim LE, and if you can run Skyrim SE on max settings without issues, you will be able to run most of texture/mesh mods without issues as well, so there is no need for "green-yellow-red" marking system as for Skyrim LE. Still, some mods have pretty "different" level of quality or some other details that may impact performance greatly on weaker PCs, and such mods will be marked with a special <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span> mark. This does NOT mean such mods will destroy your performance if you don't have "NASA PC" - but it means you should install such mods carefully (basically, testing ingame performance after such mod installation) even on strong rigs, and avoid certain options or mods entirely on weak rigs.</p>
        <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Hide">
        <div class="spoiler_wrapper" style="display: block;"><br>
          <p>First of all, let's install some "core" texture/model mods that will serve us as a base:</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659">Static Mesh Improvement Mod</a>
          A core mod that greatly improves hundreds of flat vanilla models. During the mods installations further, we'll be adding to it and improving what SMIM already improved, even more. As you may know, it's [not] recommended to start a game via vanilla (Helgen) start in a heavy-modded game, but if you're a daring one, don't forget to install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8004">fix</a> to not fly across Skyrim in prisoner cart.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5870">Ruins Clutter Improved</a>
          Speaks for its name clearly. Another one huge core mod with myriads of models and texture improvements for various ruins and related clutter. Don't forget to install the Update files and also install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21031">fix</a>.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28642">Ultimate HD Fire Effects</a>
          The fire your game deserves. Yes, the link goes to Skyrim LE version (SE version of the mod is a placebo). Here, you need to manually download the mod archive (pick the Ultra version), unpack it, and delete the \meshes folder inside. Then pack the \textures folder, add the archive to your mod manager and install as any other mod. Bingo!
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14365">Underground - a dungeon texture overhaul</a>
          Huge mod that greatly improves a lot of texture for all types of dungeons.<br>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2636" style="display:inline;">Bellyaches HD Dragon Replacer Pack</a> + <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6839" style="display:inline;">Bellyaches Animal and Creature Pack</a><br>
          A base retextures for dragons and plenty of animals/critters.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10897">High Quality Food and Ingredients</a>
          Basic omnomnom retextures.
          <p class="text_yellow">Now choose between the next few mods. Basically, they all are very big packs covering +/- same amount of textures, installing one after another will severely or almost completely overwrite the first one you've installed. As an option, you can compare texture images manually and keep the ones you like, mixing these mods. But in most cases, you won't need this, especially if you're a newcomer to Skyrim modding. Same is applied to each further "choose" notifications.</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1782">SSE Texture Pack - Osmodius</a>
          This texture pack can be basically considered a "vanilla plus" retexturing project.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3820">Skyland - A Landscape Texture Overhaul</a>
          Pretty qualitative textures pack with a great coverage as well.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/skyrim-realistic-overhaul/downloads">Skyrim Realistic Overhaul</a>
          Another one "vanilla-wise" texture overhaul with a really huge coverage. It's disadvantage is it has plenty of unnecessary 4k texture where it's absolutely not needed - not the best optimization, in other words. But it may be a great choice if you 1) just wanna bump vanilla textures, sticking to original look 2) don't actaully want install many other mods. 
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21423">Noble Skyrim Mod</a>
          This beautiful and qualitative mod stands for its name - it's an amazing texture project which gives Skyrim an indeed a noble touch. One of my two personal favourites in Skyrim SE. Install FULL pack (until you're not on a completely potato rig which struggles with Skyrim SE itself). Also don't forget to install the SMIM patch.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2347">Skyrim 2017 Textures by Pfuscher</a>
          The most popular texture pack on SE Nexus - and that's absolutely deserved. Almost all Pfuscher's textures are pure piece of art - great quality, great optimization, fresh look, yet - still sticking to original Skyrim look at the same time in most of cases. Take into account - there are a lot of separate mod ffiles at Files tab - you need to download them all, if you want maximum coverage.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5488">Vivid Landscapes - All in One</a>
          This pack doesn't give same big coverage as previous packs (mostly the landscapes and farmhouses), but it's also incredibly qualitative work and has own original look.
          <p class="text_yellow">Just a few recommendations if you can't decide what to pick: 1) Get the Skyland and then overwrite it with Noble. 2) Get only Noble 3) Get the Skyland and overwrite with Pfusher's packs. 4) Get the Noble and overwrite with Pfuscher's packs (that's what I'm using as base). Though, it's just my personal recommendations - always do as your heart and eyes are telling you :)</p>
          <p class="text_yellow">Now, caves/mines mods and few options for them. Note - for interior cells, like caves &amp; mines, you can easily grab the 4k version of the mod if it's present - interiors eat vastly less VRAM.</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8429">CC's HQ Mines</a>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8448">CC's HQ Caves</a>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10738">Gecko's Dwarven Ruins Textures</a>
          <p class="text_yellow">Now choose one from the next 3 mods which are retexturing Nordic dungeons somehow "forgotten" by big mods before, or just doing it better:</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19116">Skyland Nordic Ruins</a>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10955">Gecko's Nordic Ruins Textures</a>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19365">Rudy HQ - Nordic Ruins SE</a>
          My absolute favorite between Nordic retexturing mods - the level of details is just astonishing. You can install Skyland Nordic Ruins and then this mod on top, as Skyland covers few objects not touched by this mod. Also don't forget to get all optional addons and higher resolution textures.
          <p class="text_yellow">Fine, let's move</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8834">Blended Roads</a>
          Amazing mod doing exactly how it's called. One roads mod to rule them all.
          <p class="text_yellow">Now, choose between the next few mods:</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2154">Skyrim Flora Overhaul <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          The most popular tree mod for Skyrim which provides better textures and mods for vanilla trees, as well as new tree models.
          <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> until you absolutely love SFO's grass (in my opinion, other grass mods have grass handled better), install "Trees Only" version of the mod, as grass will be handled by other mods in the section below. Don't forget to install the update file too.
          <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> if you love this mod, but have non-pleasant FPS drops with it, try this amazing <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21529">optimized textures addon</a> for it (overwrite the mod files).
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4423">Realistic Aspen Trees</a>
          Retexture of aspen trees for a more realistic and diverse look. Yellow, orange and red colors.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> use this mod only with Skyrim Flora Overhaul or vanilla trees. EVT (listed below) has it included and "3D" trees mod (listed below) has own aspen trees modification.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5281">Simply Bigger Trees SE <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          A mod that makes trees bigger.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> similar as with previous mod, use it only with SFO and/or Realistic Aspect Trees (make sure to grab proper version in Files tab). Mods listed below are not compatible with it and don't need it. EVT, for example, has own option for bigger trees with much better performance impact.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20336">Tree Bark in High Definition</a>
          A bark texture addon.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> usage - same as previous mods - with SFO, and/or RAT, and/or SBT only. Not needeed for EVT or "3D" trees mod.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371">Skyrim 3D Trees and Plants <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          This mod is kind of double-edged sword. Some of tree models are actually looking absolutely spectacular and really have much more volumetric look, while majority of other trees are looking plastic-like due to weird inflated models and unrealistic textures. If you'll be using this mod, don't forget to intall this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25697">fix</a> for it.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11008">Enhanced Vanilla Trees <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          My personal favourite tree mod for Skyrim. It greatly improves both models and textures of the trees, giving more lush and detailed look, while sticking to original appearance of the trees at the same time, and adding some trees here and there. It also has Realistic Aspen Trees included (choose it in installer options) as well as big trees option, which is the best between all similar "bigger" tree mods in terms of effect/performance hit ratio. Also if you're planning to use 3D LODs, make sure to use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27442">this fix</a> (read the instructions carefully).
          <br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> SE version of the mod still has some non-critical visual glitches - so if you want the mod working on 100%, just use the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76086">Skyrim LE</a> version of it - download it manually, add to your mod manager for SE and isntall as usual.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24145">Lush Vanilla Trees</a>
          If you have performance issues with the mods listed above, you can try this one. Much simplier but also much more fps-friendly tree mod.
          <p class="text_yellow">Great, now a few more mods for core graphics setup:</p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8767">Immersive Fallen Trees</a>
          Stands for its name. A must-have mod, compatible with everyting. Make sure to install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27834">fix patch</a> for it.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5664">Fences of Skyrim - No more flickering fences</a>
          Same here. Twice as essential mod.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> There are different ways to install the mod. If you wanna follow my choice, install "Fences of Skyrim" main file, then overwrite with "Fences of Skyrim - Weathered Edition 2K" and then with "Barbed wire Add-on for Weathered Edition". Also install Vivid Landscapes patch if you're using Vivid Landscapes.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909">aMidianBorn Book of Silence</a>
          The quality of Cabal (Amibianborn) mods simply doesn't get worse with years. It's still unrivaled for many armors/creatures/objects models/textures - we will overwrite it with some other mods here and there, but it's a solid base for armors, weapons, creatures and some unique items models and textures improvement.<br>
          <div class="note_pink">How to install:</div>
          <div>- Install the mod files in this order: Armors, Creatures, Dragonborn DLC, Unique Items, Weapons. Always overwrite. Don [not] install Content Addon.</div>
          <div>- From Miscellaneous files section, install Bonemold Hotfix, Skyforge Hotfix and Staff of Magnus Hotfix. You need to download these files manually, add to mod manager and install.</div>
          <div>- Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12963">this</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21792">this</a> fixes.</div>
          <div>- Optionally, install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27994">retexture addon</a> for elven weapons.
          <div>- Optionally, install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/6960965?tab=user+files&amp;BH=2">retextures for elven and glass armors.
          </a><a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/901">Book Covers Skyrim</a>
          The one and only mod to retexture close to every book in the game. Desaturated version recommended.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2357">Enhanced Blood Textures</a>
          The ultimate blood and blood decals texture mod. I'd recommend to install High Res Darker Color version (choosing in installer). Mod also offers patches for Skyrim Immersive Creatures and SkyBirds mods - you most likely will be using them both, so just tick on the patches options - if you won't be using SkyBirds or SIC, just delete patches .esp files later.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12939">Deadly Spell Impacts</a>
          Essential mod for HD spell impacts.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182">Realistic Water Two</a>
          Best water mod ever made for Skyrim. Install the main file and then ENB textures file. Also, download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10808">Water's Edge Fix</a> - but we will install it a bit later.<br>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10305" style="display:inline;">HD Photorealistic Ivy</a> + <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8938" style="display:inline;">Ivy Replacer by Pfuscher</a><br>
          Make ivys great again!
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2407">Dust Effects</a>
          Much better, more realistic dust particles look.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27038">Jewels of the Nord - HD rings and necklaces</a>
          An almost essential HD texture and mesh replacer for rings and necklaces. It's LE mod, but it works just fine in SE.

          <p>
            <span class="note_pink">Note #1:</span> Always read the grass mod pages carefully, as each mod usually requires of settings in Skyrim.ini [GRASS] section. Implement them.<br>
            <span class="note_pink">Note #2:</span> If you absolutely love some grass mod, and can use it, but FPS hit is bigger than you expected, you can always play with grass density settings, namely the <span class="color_blue">iMinGrassSize=</span> value. The LOWER is the value, the DENSER is the grass - so if you wanna more FPS, make the value HIGHER (try 80, 100 or even 120).
          </p>
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25459">Northern Grass <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          My personal favourite between the grass mods available on SE Nexus. A great combination picked from other popular grass mods with a beautiful, dense and immersive result. Don't forget to install the fix file as well.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22437">Voluptuous Grasses-The T H I C C K E N I N G <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          My second personal favourite between the grass mods available on SE Nexus. Beautiful and original look with great coverage that makes groundcovers look much more volumetric.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296">Verdant - A Skyrim Grass Plugin <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>

          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26293">Veydosebrom - Grass and Groundcover <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          Another qualitative grass mod  that combines several grass resources. Also has a "spring" version of the mod available in the FOMOD installer.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13686">Viscous Foliage- a T H I C C grass mod <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          A beautiful grass mod with a "wild" touch.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27530">Short Grass<span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          Short green grass mod, looking pretty fresh and original, but also has great FPS hit.
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17909">Grass Field - More colors <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
          Vibrant "green" grass mod.

          Pretty fresh, with almost all the same-looking grass in each region, but really dense grass mod. Note: it [WILL] hit your FPS like a truck.
          <p class="text_yellow">The next 4 mods are optional, get a peek:</p>

          Adds beautiful green grass to Whiterun streets.<br>
          <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> as a drawback, this mod will perform EXTERMINATUS your FPS in Whiterun, even on strong gaming rig. Even on GPU like RTX 2070 it may give you from 15 to 20 fps hit alone. Use with caution :)

          <p>About these mods and which one to choose. Majestic is my personal #2 favourite mod, Northfire's are really photorealistic which fits the mod name, Excellent Mountains is a little gem from Pfuscher with immersive look and inredible texture details, Real and Rustic are pretty much close to vanilla look, and 8k (exactly the 8k version is an absolutely overkill, so use 2k or 4k if you want that much) and CC's UHQ mods are both looking pretty unique. But what mod you're using, Sinitar?

          This mod tweaks the foggy weathers by making them more...guess what...yeah, you guessed correctly. Pick the correct version when installing, depending which weather mod you will be using (or vanilla weathers).
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7397">Dimmer Fog and More</a>

          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6178">Inside the Nebula</a>
          My favourite mod for fantasy-looking night sky. Yes, it's LE mod - just download manually, then add to and install with your mod manager into SE.

          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5561">Skyrim Textures Redone - Enhanced Night Sky</a>

          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20301">8K Night Skies - Stars and Galaxies</a>
          Retexture for galaxy and-starts that sticks close to vanilla look. While actually being in 8k which makes no practical sense at all, mod still has 4k variants which you can use (or safely to compress to 2k using Ordenator or Photoshop).
          <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1477">More Alien Skyrim - Galaxy Nebula Sun Sunglare and Star</a>

        <p>Weather and lighting - realistic storms and snowfalls, new weathers, both grim and vibrant up to your taste, grealy improved &amp; more realistic world lighting, and completely new immersive little things - from rainbows to rain splashes. Everything is here. Make sure that ENB presets are often tweaked for certain weather and/or lighting mod, so it won't look properly with some random weather/lighting mod installed. Incompatibility between ENB preset and weather/lighting mods does [NOT] mean your game will crash or something, but ENB may look weird. Remember this if you'll decide to switch your weather/lighting mod.</p>

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125">Obsidian Weathers and Seasons</a>
            My personal favourite between all weather mods for Skyrim SE, from the authors of the most amazing weather mod for Skyrim LE - NLVA. Obsidan adds plenty of new weathers while keeping the ambience in the borders of canonic Skyrim look. Sharp and beautiful coulds, diverse weathers, volumetric mountain fogs and much more, making a beautiful, truly Skyrim'ish picture. It's also the most ENB-supported weather mod, meaning the amount of ENB presets available to choose from, tweaked for it.<br>

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2187">Vivid Weathers</a>
            The most popular weather mod for Skyrim SE which stands for its name - vivid, vibrant, tasty weathers with a very big variety. The subjective downside of the is that it makes game really more bibrant in many cases, so if you like cinematic/realistic look, that most likely not your best candidate. The objective drawback is that it has somewhat more minor visual glitches than the LE version of the mod, but it's nothing critical and on practice, most likely you won't even notice. Also has enough of ENB presets tweaked for it, but not close as much as Obsidian has, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7895">Dolomite Weathers</a>
            While Dolomite is technically a predcessor to Obsidian, I personally still prefer some elements from it over Obsidian's composition. It's really diverse, with plenty of beautiful weathers (but now that vibrant as Vivid Weathers), and with absolutely unrivaled clouds look. Also, if you possibly love it's rain/snow effects, but wanna use other weather mod, you can use this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8006">little addon</a> with other weather mods.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2237">Climates Of Tamriel</a>
            "Old but good" weather mod that's making Skyrim weathers more interesting than it was in vanilla game, but still sticking much to original atmosphere as much as possible. One can call it "vanilla weathers plus". Alternative sounds <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12205">patch</a> available.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15884">Aequinoctium - Weathers and Seasons</a>
            A sharp, fantasy-realism weather mod with a noticeable photorealism touch. You can also make a nice mix - using Obsidian, but with some Aequinoctium weathers merged in it, with the help of this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16117">patch</a>. Also has a good support in terms of ENB presets available.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12842">NAT - Natural and Atmospheric Tamriel</a>
            An amazing candidate if you wanna weathers and general ambience be more cinematic. Also has a good support in terms of ENB presets available. But take into account while most of weather mods are giving 0 performance impact, NAT is much "heavier" compared to other weather mods for some reasons.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8398">Rustic Weathers and Lighting</a>

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2770">Surreal Lighting -- vibrant and cheerful weathers and lighting</a>
            Deep fantasy weather/lighting mod with gentle purple touch. Take into account though that it's [both] weather and lighting mod at the same time, so it may have minor conflicts with lighting mods here and there, so use with caution/testing.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11578">Mythical Ages - weathers and lighting overhaul</a>

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791">Cathedral Weathers and Seasons</a>
            This weather mod is using some assets from Obsidian and Aequinoctium mods listed above, resulting in somewhat mixed look of these two. It also has a customization spell through which you can adjust saturation, contrast and so on. At the same time, as all ENB presets are tweaked for certain weather mods and certain conditions, usage of this options together with ENB becoming obsolete, as ENB control over the same values is superior - much more precize and easy to use. This mod also sadly doesn't have much ENB presets adjusted for it compared to mods like Obsidian or Dolomite for example, but it's an option for those who are not able to run ENB at all due to weak PC - in this case mod's customization may come in handy.

            The mod make all types of storms much more realistic - severe, loud, deep, by overhauling both visual and audio apperance of them. For me personally, it's doing this job better than any other weather mod above. But what about compatibility? Worry not! Check out this amazing author's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/44265462?tab=user+files&amp;BH=0">page</a> to get a compatibility for "Wet and Cold" immersion mod, as well as for most of other popular weather mods.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424">Enhanced Lights and FX</a>  
            The well-deserved most endorsed lighting mod of all times. A complete overhaul to vanilla lighting while keeping it simple and not going away from original look. Better lighting. New light sources where needed. More realistic lighting in dungeons and other interiors. Huge coverage. Best support from the side of ENB presets. Everything is here. Personal recommendation - if you're aimed on a heavy mod list, choose only the core mod itself and enhancer option (and ofc SMIM-related option) - don't choose exteriors option. And don't use ELFX weathers module - it's not compatible with other weather mods and almost not supported by ENB presets. Lastly, choose "no [vanilla player home name]" or "no player homes" if you are planning to use mods that overhaul vanilla player home/s. It also has plenty of addons to improve it/make more compatible. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5520">This patch</a> plus <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7764">this patch</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27084">this one</a> are [absolutely essential]. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18634">This one</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25498">this one</a> are very much recommended as well. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18299">This mod</a> has some patches for mods you may possibly have.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/844">Realistic Lighting Overhaul</a>
            Another simply great lighting mod of a huge coverage and great popularity. Aims on similar things like ELFX does, but has different look here and there. May give you a few more FPS compared to ELFX usage if you're on a somewhat weak rig, but comes with much, much worse support of ENB presets (meaning there are almost no ENB presets that are officially and fulyl tweaked for it). You may also find useful <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11299">this mod</a> which offers patches for two popular mods, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18004">this</a> one as well (ofc, use them only if you'll be using the named mods).

            These are two mods, but can be considered as a single one, as they perfectly compatible and basically should be used together. Alternative and more lightweight approach to changing the game lighting - if you aren't sure, just try both mods above, and this combo, and then choose one you like the most :) You may also find <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26538">"no players homes" patch</a> useful (meaning you need it IF you're be using mods that affects vanilla player homes), as well as this one <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27162">tiny fix</a> (choose the "Relighting Skyrim - Old Hroldan Fix" main file).

            One of the most simple yet one of the most favorite mods of such type for me personally. It makes huge amount of Skyrim roards to look more authentic and logical. It's also perfectly compatible with almost all the mods in this section. My personal advice is to install version without bridges coverage to be able to use bridges-dedicated mods below. Installing [all] main files is also recommended.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162">Enhanced Landscapes <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
            Absolutely huge, whole-game-covering mod. It adds litearlly thousands of new objects here and there - from trees and cliffs, to urns and statues. Forets, shores, mountains - everything in your game will have a fresh, yet pretty lore-friendly touch. Mod also fulyl supports 3D LODs from DynDOLOD. It has some flaws as well though - sometimes the placements of new objects are feeling generic and non much logical and it still has visual glitches (mostly clipping or floating objects) here and there. Due to huge coverage it also may have compatibility issues (like clipping) if you will also have plenty of other landscape overhauls and settlement mods, so here you will need to be careful or just don't have much other similar mods alongside it. Those issues are mostly cosmetic and won't break your game in technical meaning - the mod itself is simply huge and really great - so test it and decide yourself :) To help you solve some possible compatibility issues easily, take a look at this neat <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25522">patches page</a> covering compatibility with some popular mods.

Also take a look on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25212">patches</a> page - but take into account that mod doesn't have FOMOD installer - download the archive manually, delete all patches you don't need, keep those you do, archive it back, add to your mod manager and install.

            A mod with similar goal and coverage, but somewhat different approach. Don't use together with previous mod, choose only one.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22053">Trees Addon</a>
            A really well-made tree mod that follows "quality over quantity" approach and carefully places trees here and there to make scenery look better. It also adds beautiful "king trees" from Enderal to Skyrim.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8306">Bent Pines II</a>
            Another mod that adds huge trees here and there, but with different look. Technically, you can use it together with Trees Addon, but on practice, I'd recommend to choose one.
          </p>

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21934">Dark Forests of Skyrim</a>
            My personal favorite between all landscape/tree overhauls. It places several thousands of trees/plants over the Skyrim, yet doing this very carefully &amp; logically. It features both dead and new alive trees types, making some places more grim and other - more alive, fitting the overall ambience of the regions. It's also more performance-friendly and better compatibility-wise, then, for example, Enhanced Landscapes and has full 3D LODs support. EVT as main tree mod and balanced, cinematic ENB preset like Rudy ENB are recommended to be used with it.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20636">Project Rainforest - A Tropical Climate and Environment Overhaul</a>
            SKyrim SE really lack summer/spring landscape overhauls, but gladly this amazing (and pretty underrated) mod is here. It's a tropical rainforest overhaul for the Skyrim, covering most worldspaces of the base game and DLCs minus the visual overkill. Trees, plants, grasses, weather ambience, sounds - everything to transform Skyrim into tropical-looking beauty. It's also highly compatible with popular tree/landscape mods, but ofc, it's better to build visual setup around this mod in first turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18247">Skyrim 3D Landscapes</a>
            This mod is really a massive work, but pretty much as "3D" trees mod, it often suffers from look of plants that absolutely doesn't fit into Skyrim. Some plants are also too saturated/bright, which you can ofc fix in Photoshop or similar program if you like the mod in general. This mod may fit much better with some spring/summer overhaul for Skyrim (which SE sadly doesn't have that many).

          <p>
            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9933">The Ruins</a>
            Beautiful mod that adds various ruined structures and statues across Skyrim. The flaw of this one is sometimes it may feel "too much" in certain places, and mod also has some events and references that are not lore-friendly and made for fun (for example, Shrek references). Still, this is all up to player's taste :)

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22071">Winter Overhaul 2019</a>
            An all-in-one overhaul that turns Skyrim into a real winter region - whole of it, from the author of Dark Forests of Skyrim. New snow-covered trees, dead trees, more snowy weathers, snow-covered cities and so on. If you always thought that Skyrim should be more cold and snowy - that's a perfect mod for you. Compatible with Obsidian and Vivid Weathers. Compatible with survival/immersion mods like Frostwall/Wet and Cold.<br>
            <span class="note_pink">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> do NOT use it with other massive landscape overhauls, as this will definitely lead to massive clipping and other conflicts, and just weird look.

            <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20382">Nordic Ruins of Skyrim</a>
            Absolutely brilliant that overhauls some of the most memorable Nordic ruins of Skyrim, making the look much more badass, but immersive, feeling like the original part of the game at the same time. A must-have mod in my humble opinion.

            Adds several wooden bridges across the northern marshlands of Hjaalmarch (the region where some bridges would actually not hurt, imo). You CAN use this mod together with one of previous mods as it only adds new bridges.

      <div class="center_img"><img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/rGgcaDf.png" alt=""></div>
      <p>Towns, cities, villages, forts &amp; camps. Everything to make them look better, expand, and sometimes even redbuild completely. Take into account that in most of cases, you shouldn't use more than one mod that affects the same settlement, as this will lead to major clipping issues or a completely borked look - so if you're relatively new to modding, always just choose one mod affecting certain area. But ofc there are some exclusions and some mod covering same settlements can be used together - on-fly or with certain tweaks - I'll notify about that. Mods that add NEW settlements/buldings will be added in the next update together with a compelte miniguide into "ultimate settlements overhaul". Also take into account that some of these mods can heavily impact your FPS if you're not on high-end rig.</p>
      <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <p class="text_yellow">First of all, let's take a look at some "big" settlements overhauls - the mods that cover many settlelements at once with certain own style:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289">JK's Skyrim <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
        The most popular towns'n'cities overhaul, and it's pretty deserved - nothing from similar mods can compete with JK's Skyrim in terms of amount of various details and clutter added to cities and towns. Coverage: Whiterun, Windhelm, Solitude, Markarth, Riften, Riverwood, Dragon Bridge, Ivarstead, Rorikstead, Falkreath, Morthal, Dawnstar, Winterhold, Skaal Village and Skyhaven Temple. Don't use it with Dawn of Skyrim, ETAC all-in-on and The Great Cities collection listed below. If you want to mix, you can choose modular version of ETAC and/or separate "great cities" mods. You can also use separate JK's mods for certain city/town, but sadly there are only few available, unlike for SKyrim LE. Mod's Files section also provides plenty of patches for other popular mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9074">Dawn of Skyrim (Director's Cut)</a>
        My personal city overhaul favourite at the moment. Great visual improvement while having light fps impact [plus] new interiors integrated into radiant quests system. Coverage: Whiterun, Windhelm, Solitude, Markarth, Riften - you can use it with any other settlement mod that doesn't affect cities.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13552">Expanded Towns and Cities</a>
        An atmospheric overhaul with own unique touch, references and much more things here and there. The flaw of this mod is it has plenty of bugs here and there - they are not critical and don't bloat your save or something, but if you like seamless glitch-free experience, you may want to wait until it's more clean. Currently, despite the name, it covers only plenty of towns and doesn't touch cities - so you can use it with city-only mods like Dawn of Skyrim. For towns and villages - read mod page compatibility notes.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272">The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns</a>
        The mod name is somewhat confusing - it doesn't cover cities (at least, for now) - only towns, namely the Dawnstar, Dragon Bridge, Falkreath, Morthal, Rorikstead﻿﻿﻿﻿ and Winterhold﻿﻿. This mod is my personaly favourite for towns as it has absolutely fresh, original approach, while staying lore-friendly. I'm personally using it with Dawn of Skyrim for cities coverage. You can also try separate mods from the same author if you wanna mix things up. If you wanna use it with JK's Skyrim, there's a nice <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25282">mashup plugin</a> here (you still need both mods themselves). The drawback of using them together is that compatibility patches for other popular mods made either for JK's Skyrim or Great Cities may not work properly.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7777">Settlements Expanded</a>
        My personal favourite villages mod which overhauls vanilla villages and adds a few new one. Cverage: Sarethi Farm, Heartwood Mill, Kolskeggr Mine, Loreius Farm, Soljunds Sinkhole, Whistling Mine + Coldstone Mine (new village). This mod IS compatible with Arthmoor's village mods (and it's recommended to use them together). Mod Files section also provides plenty of patches for other popular mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/684492?tab=user+files&amp;BH=0">Arthmoor's Village Mods</a>
        I've added a link to author's profile to not cluster the section with too many links. Arthmoor provides light-weight yet neat overhauls for many vanilla villages. Sadly, all-in-one overhaul (as for Skyrim LE) is not available, so you'll have to install the one by one and then possibly merge if you'll need plugin space. Compatible with Settlements Expanded. About other mods covering same villages - read the mod pages. Coverage: Ivarstead, Kynesgrove, Shor's Stone, Darkwater Crossing, Whistling Mine, Karthwasten, Soljund's Sinkhole, Helarchen Creek.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16530">Skyrim Reborn - Whiterun Hold</a>
        A massive overhaul for almost 20 "tiny" places in Whiterun hold - standing stones, bandit camps, towers etc. Compatible or close to 99% compatible with any settlement overhaul and compatible with mods of landscape overhaul - only may cause some minor clipping here and there. The only flaw of this mod is that changes for most of places of similar type are looking almost the same.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">ATTENTION:</span> read the list of included mods carefully - don't use them or mods that are possibly covering same places.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23968">Goodfellow's Whiterun Hold</a>
        One more simple, but highly immersive whiterun hold overhaul.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6481">Imperial Stone - The Forts of Skyrim Redone</a>
        Absolutely great mod that overhauls many prominent Skyrim forts, making them look as they initially should: Fort Greymoor, Fort Sungard, Fort Greenwall, Fort Snowhawk, Fort Hraggstad, Fort Amol, Fort Kastav, Fort Neugrad, Fort Dunstad, Northwatch Keep.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> mod is currently hidden by its author due to update process - track it and check out from time to time, as it's really a worth-to-install one.
        <p class="text_yellow">Now, I want to point yount attention on some not "whole-covering" (mostly single-settlement), but highly prominent mods that cover this or that settlement. Consider this my personal "essential mods besides the big overhauls" section:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10135">Paradise City for Vanilla Skyrim -- Great Trees for Cities <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
        In my opinion, this one is the best cities tree mod ever - beautiful, yet logically places trees for these settlements: Whiterun, Riften, Windhelm, Rorikstead. Compatible or almost compatible (with just a minor clipping that you can just disable in console) with all mods that afffects same settlements. Works especialyl great with Dawn of Skyrim. Also fully compatible with DynDOLOD generator.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/643">Better Tel Mithryn</a>
        An expansion of the settlement of Tel Mithryn. Includes docks, a main gate, new merchants, guards, and more.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851">Quaint Raven Rock</a>
        ESP-only overhaul. Extremely lore-friendly yet detailed at the same time, with interesting new features and details.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27816">Enhanced Solitude</a>
        Absolutely breathtaking, masterpiece work of talented Kojak - the author literally combined various best of the best improvements affecting Solitude in this or that way from couple dozens of mods and made an ultimate Solitude addon, which is, moreover, ultra-compatible with other city mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22243">The Great City of Solitude</a>
        Amazing Solitude exterior overhaul - compatible with mods like JK/Dawn that change Solitude inside.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> don't use ELFX Exteriors option with it to avoid clipping. Well, don't use ELFX Exterior option in general if you're aimed on heavy settlements overhaul (once again).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5824">Windhelm Exterior Altered</a>
        Made some changed on the existing dock also added a new dock/harbour outside Windhelm. Compatible with most of city mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10134">Old Hroldan Ruins</a>
        Fixes a discrepancy in which there should be even the ruins of an ancient settlement of what used to be Hroldan as described in lore.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16178">Stendarr's Beacon Enhanced and Ruhmastered</a>
        Absolutely essential little gem. Expands &amp; improves Stendarr's Beacon, making it more functional for those playing as, with, or against the Vigilants of Stendarr. Adds new, lore-appropriate interior zones, outbuildings, and decor to complement the Vigil's aesthetic. Compatible with VIGILANT quest mod.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21788">Stonehills Reborn</a>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13348">Mixwater Mill Reborn</a>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13239">Anga's Mill Reborn</a>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/642">Greater Skaal Village</a>
        Compatible with JK's Skaal Village changes.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3176">T'Skyrim - Riverwood (Addon for JK's Skyrim) <span class="fps_hit">==FPS==</span></a>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> to be used ONLY with JK's Riverwood (or JK's Skyrim).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8639">Snowy AF Windhelm</a>
        Makes how it's called. For good compatibility, usage with JK's Skyrim is recommended with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ez6JMTTBf-rlQf63at0w_cuF3Cp1CsI/view">this patch</a>. Other City mods are not officially supported.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19026">Immersive Farms</a>
        Tiny, totally optional but a cool mod that adds more crops to many villages/towns farms. Greatly compatible with mods of settlement overhauls.
        <p class="text_yellow">Interior overhauls. Skyrim SE lacks some promiment interior overhauls, but still have a few gems as well. Take into account that they may (and will in almost all cases) conflict if you'll be trying to use them together to get the biggest possible coverage, but it's easily fixed - just open mods affecting same cells in xEDit and delete the named cell from one of the mods and save.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130">Distinct Interiors</a>
        Small, simple changes to make interiors more distinct and recognizable. Don't forget to get the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23831">fix</a> addon.

        The great overhaul for dozens of interiors with amazing fantasy touch. Mod is hosted on LE page - get the "Enhanced Interiors SSE Beta" file. SE version is not officially supported tho.

        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> if you wanna use it with Distinct Interiors, use its modular version.
        <p class="text_yellow">Gooood. Now a plenty of various smaller mods that changes single city/town/adds different things here and there. Amount of the mods is, similar to many cases, is not that big to choose from as for Skyrim LE, but there's still quite a few available. Take into account that some of them maybe be 100% compatible with big mods above, some may be not. Just read the mod pages attentively and you'll be fine.</p>

      <p>All mods here are NOT obligatory for installation - but it's recommended to go through them still, as it will greatly improve hundreds of more objects not touched before, or improve better then previous "big" mods with often absolutely exceptional quality. The section below is the biggest one in meaning of mods quantity - so don't be afraid when you'll open it. This is a process of plesantly smashing each ugly texture left, as much as possible. Creatures, dragons, armors and weapons, food, ingots, plants and hundreds of other objects till the tiniest details, like ruined books or gold pouches. Many mods will ask you to overwrite - as your game has huge amount of objects retextured already. Just approve overwriting and keep going. It often also may come up to personal taste - so look on each mod page, choose what you like and what not. Enjoy.</p>

        Better body models, head models. Better textures for skin, eyes, hair, brows, beards etc. Usually, you can install as many eyes and hair mods as you want - just be sure these mods are standalone. Situation with body and skin mods is different - you can have only one in each category (on top of UNP or CBBE, usually), so choose which you like the most. Absolutely all choices here are nothing else but matter of taste - so read the mod pages, look at screenshots and choose whatever you like.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> mods in this section often have textures from 1k to 4k and even 8k resolution for skin, 2k or 4k resolution for bears etc - use such high-res version only in case you're aiming on screenarchery. For regular gameplay, taking something like 8k skin or 2k brows makes no practical sense and will just waste your VRAM. FPS hit will depend completely and only on your resolution choice.

      <p>Here we go with the list of mods that improve visual appearance of NPCs - female, male and children. Here you can find something for any taste (besides the absolutely irrealistic overhauls which are not included). Current list contains standalone mods - these mods don't require other mods to work properly, plug'n'play!<br>
      <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> such mods may be or not be compatible, as most of them change many NPCs, you can have situation when you want to install two mods, but they change some same NPCs. In this case, place the mod you like the most after. For example, you want to use MOD1 and MOD2. Both of them change Lydia. You like Lydia from MOD2. Place MOD2 after MOD1 to give it bigger priority and you'll be fine in most of cases.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11287">Bijin NPCs</a>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11247">Bijin Wives</a>
        Legendary mods that beautify many memorable female characters. My personal favorite between all similar mods for named characters, an essential mod series for me personally. You may also be interested in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20318">alternative look</a> addon for Lydia, Aela and Ria, as well as in "customizers" for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21355">warmaidens</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21341">NPCs</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21358">wives</a> respectively.

        <p class="text_yellow">Now just a minute of your attention to our best bae, Serana. Choose one between these mods:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13027">Seranaholic</a>
        Amazing overhaul of Serana with several different versions and options, also offering Valerica overhaul (Files tab). From the author of Bijin series. I'm using this one for Serana and Valerica.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2409">Superb Serana</a>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24931">Pandorable's Serana</a>
        My personal #2 favorite.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8393">Serana and Claire</a>
        Also offers a standalone follower version with different character name (if you like this look, but also want original Serana affected by another mod).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10205">Serana no ESP</a>
        <p class="text_yellow">Ok, let's continue.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19012">Pandorable's NPCs</a>
        A really great female overhaul which has a good balance between attarctiveness and "not too much". Its another huge advantage is it's fully compatible with whole Bijin series, covering only NPCs not touched by Bijin mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20264">Skyrim Beautiful Followers</a>
        This mod is definitely not much lore-friendly, but it covers just huge amount of NPCs and the quality is actually good. Take into account you need to install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37861">Skyrim LE version</a> of the mod first, and then overwrite its .esp file with this one.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12376">The Ordinary Women</a>
        A great alternative if you don't like Bijin mod series. It also covers some NPCs not covered by Bijin, so you can use both together, with load order depending on your preference.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13789">Fresh Faces</a>
        A small NPC overhaul mod with own approach to some female NPCs look.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22025">Metalsabers Beautiful Orcs of Skyrim</a>
        Dedicated and pretty good overhaul for female orc characters. Take into account that it uses [your] skin &amp; eyes mods, so end result may vary.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21972">Metalsabers Elegant Elves of Skyrim</a>
        Similar overhaul for female elves, from the same author.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4345">Aesthetic Elisif</a>
        Give your future High Queen the facelift she needs.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20173">Skyrim Ladies - Astrid</a>
        A really well-made Astrid overhaul.
        <p class="text_yellow bold">Male overhauls. Yeah, not that much here.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10902">The Men of Winter</a>
        My personal favourite for males. You may also like this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19861">addon</a> for it.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18976">Dx's Better Men of Skyrim</a>
        Alternative mod for some of promiment skyrim guys.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/920">Distinct Husbands</a>
        A visual overhaul of the male spouses.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13142">TDN Improved Lucien - Spectral Assassin Replacer</a>
        Lucien in the best shape!
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1920">Erik the Slayer - Now Older and Wiser for</a>
        Older and wiser indeed.
        <p class="text_yellow bold">Mods covering both guys and gals.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24135">Pandorable's NPCs - Dawnguard</a>
        From the authoress of Pandorable NPCs mod, here goes her beautiful overhaul for many female and male Dawnguard DLC characters.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11218">Inhabitants of Skyrim - NPC Overhaul</a>
        Really great coverage and close-to-vanilla look in most of cases.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19200">Followers Hirelings and Housecarls</a>
        Pretty much stands for its name - changes several dozens of NPCs, with a big care about original look.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7581">Distinct People</a>
        Another big-covering overhaul. Take into account though that it requires KS Hairdos and also uses whatever skin/eyes mods you have, so the end result may vary.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8541">Realistic faces</a>
        Around 80 NPCs altered, with new hairs and better skin look, while also tryign to stick close to original appearance.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7956">Improved Bards</a>
        Standalone mod that replaces the appearance of the bards across Skyrim.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27330">Cuyima Interesting NPCs</a>
        The biggest and best existing overhaul for over a HUNDRED of characters in "Interesting NPCs" mod. Obviously, use this mod only if you have 3D NPCs isntalled.
        <p class="text_yellow bold">Children overhauls.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650">RS Children Overhaul</a>
        A well-deserved most popular children overhaul. To say objectively, the SE version of the mod has more bugs than LE version. The issues are cosmetic and won't break your game, but still it's need to be mentioned. Also, you most likely will have to apply <a href="https://youtu.be/vd1azG3TwS0">this fix</a> until the mod is updated. For great compatibility with other mods, there are 2 patches pages <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13409">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8835">here</a>.

      <p>Now let's get to UI (shortening from User Interface) mods. Icons, widgets, notifications, proper menus look on all resolutions - that's all UI. So a good UI mod always comes in handy. The main task of UI mods is to make your gameplay more comfortable, navigating in menus more intuitive, adding more useful widgets and spending less time in menues in general, enjoing the gameplay. Some of the absolutely essential UI mods like SkyUI or Better Dialogue/Messagebox Controls you already have - but there're quite a few more amazing mods to serve you.</p>

        A quality dungeon and house mod that greatly expands the College Midden, with minimal changes to existing areas. A new lore-friendly player home serves as a hub for new dungeons. 100% compatible with Immersive College of Winterhold.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2479">Dwemer Network</a>

        For those who are making the Nth run of the game, this mod adds a trapdoor leading to the area with the word wall, but also adds the golden claw to the same area, saving you the trouble of going back to save Arvel.

        This mod adds many draugrs and enemy wizards, and it also imroves the ghost blade.
        <p class="text_yellow">Now, plenty of great mods that adds new dungeons of different type. First let's see some dungeon "packs" that add several or more dungeons:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131">Skyrim Underground</a>
        One of the most amazing dungeon mod I ever played! An underground dungeon system with currently 42 large and 26 small cells. Tunnels are connecting different Skyrim cities. Also constantly updated. Amazing design, dark atmosphere, tonns of new, creepy creatures to fight and just HUGE size in total. In my opinion, this mod is absolutely must-have. If you'll be exploring it really carefully, you can even stumble upon several NPCs voiced by your humble :)
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9320">Skyrim Sewers 4</a>
        Mod adds an accessible sewers system to the town of Solitude, Whiterun, Windhelm and Markarth and also small sewage tunnels to Fort Sungard and Greenwall + new custom weapons and unique books. There's an <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19211">Outlaws Refugees</a> patch available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449">Forgotten Dungeons</a>
        Mod adds 49 new radiant-quest enabled dungeons in Skyrim. Good design, tonns of enemies. All sizes - from little to huge. This mod will give you dozens of hours to explore.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186">Hammet's Dungeon Packs</a>
        Another great dungeon pack currently having 31 new dungeons in Skyrim and Soltheim. Dungeons in this pack are mostly oriented on high-level characters with level 40 and higher. Radiant-quest enabled. Some of dungeons contain new items and spellbooks. I'm using this one now personally - loving it level design more than in previous mod.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2218">EasierRider's Dungeon Pack</a>
        Adds 7 new, lore-friendly dungeons around Skyrim, with absolutely amazing dungeon design - plus, as it's pretty small amount of dungeons in it, you can use it freely with one of two mods above (using both are too much, imo - you don't want to stubmle across a new dungeons each 5 minutes of gameplay, I believe).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16706">Immersive Dungeons</a>
        Mod adds 7 new dungeons with great design to explore and fight with atmospheric story-based exploration.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16705">The Unfinished Business - Dungeon Pack</a>
        Add several short dungeons with a short stories related to small towns of Skyrim.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19488">The Rabbit Hole</a>
        This mod doesn't add many new dungeons in wilderness - there's only one entrance, but the dungeon itself is multi-leveled vertically. In my opinion it’s criminally underrated and absolutey must-play. Mod adds dungeon system, a ‘rabbit hole’ with 50!! levels with progressing difficulty. Also many secrets and hidden rooms to discover. Have fun!
        <p class="text_yellow">Now, single-dungeon mods, but with a great qualty - challenging bossfights, breathtaking design or sometimes even everything together:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2024">Apotheosis - Lifeless Vaults</a>
        Absolutely awesome mod inspired by Dark Souls. Winner of ‘boss battles’ competition at Reddit. Amazingly detailed cells with 5 giant and very hard, unique-looking and fighting bosses that you’ll remember for sure for a long time. If you’re looking for new challenges - try this mod for sure! Also this mod mod is only a ‘preview’ of huge incoming ‘Apotheosis’ mod that would be released in future.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11486">Red Flame</a>
        A vampire-themed dungeon featuring original music, Deirge Cathedral lies off of the coast of Skyrim's northern shore. A mass of stone and stained glass, the mod features two new foods for vampires, a Molag Bal blessing, a unique Gargoyle summon spell, and three weapons.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23362">The Temple of Black Rock</a>
        An unforgettable adventure through huge nordic ruins. Another deadly dungeon for heavy leveled characters.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23360">The Secret of Dragonhead</a>
        Amazing, dark, greatly designed and challenging. Dungeon mod from previous mod author, MannyGT.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21177">Demonika</a>
        VERY dark. VERY creepy. Full of enemies. Dungeon mod with 12 stages. This mod may even scare someone, it’s not for everyone. But if you like such kind of creepy playthrough - try it for sure!

      <p>For these mods, you can install as many as you want, technially but if mod that you're installing is affecting leveled lists, be sure to rebuild your Bashed Patch. Also take into account that leveled lists have own limitations in size, so it's not a good idea to install 5 biggest weapon packs at the same time, because most likely you'll never see many of items ingame even with Bashed Patch. Choose one or two big weapon/armor packs and polish this by several smaller mods you like. It's literally impossible to list absolutely all great mod of this category here as there are hundreds or even thousands of such mods, so that's just mostly my personal list of mods that are either beautiful and lore-friendly, or I admire them for really unique look and/or great textures quality. Still, there are many mods here that improves or rebalances vanilla items or add new, but absolutely immersive ones.</p>

        The latest armor mod pack from Zerofrost and that has definitely the absoutely amazingly armors - for male, female and both genders.

        <div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 15px;"><iframe src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/Ks2euxfYtaM.html" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0" class="sumg_vid"></iframe><iframe src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/l-meuiyaCXI.html" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0" class="sumg_vid"></iframe></div>
        <p class="text_yellow bold">First of all, let's look on weapon packs - mods that contain many or at least several weapons inside them:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9660">Lore Weapon Expansion</a>
        My personal favourite between all big weapon packs. Varietive but not too big and with qualitative textures for each weapons without exceptions. And what is good, it's really lore-friendly.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8206">InsanitySorrow Weapons Pack <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        A compilation of standalone mods (that are not included in previous pack) from the same author, ported from LE. I humbly recommend installing this pack as well - it includes many unique weapons for warriors, thieves and archers, which are still really, really immersive.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3334">Unique Uniques</a>
        A mod from previous mod author that makes unique weapons look really unique.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6994">Royal Armory - New Artifacts</a>
        A must-have mod. Adds special weapons to the most important characters in Skyrim with unique effects and appearance. This may sound very simply, but it really changes the way you will look on many quests and NPCs - because now they will be a more than worthy targets. Make sure to install amazing mesh/texture improvement <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28006">addon</a> for it. Optional tweaks <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26398">patch</a> is also available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16788">Immersive Weapons</a>
        The biggest weapon pack ever. Enourmous variety of weapons. This may act as a subjective disadvantage - some people don't want so much (as some weapons are looking not very immersive actually), but it's all a matter of taste. Take a look at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16803">patches page</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20678">Morrowloot patch</a> (works for MUS too) if needed.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308">Heavy Armory - New Weapons</a>
        One of my favourite wepon packs as well. This mod adds nearly 100 new weapons to Skyrim. You will find all new Halberds, Spears, Glaives, Shortswords, Quarter staves, Mauls, Hatchets and Clubs. Optional <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16737">addon</a> for enchanted weapons distribution is available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8273">Legendary Skyrim Crossbows</a>
        Amazing mod that adds dozens of new crossbows, some bows and unique arrows/bolts to the game. Crossbows have very qualitative models.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/912">Scoped Bows</a>
        Simple but brilliant mod that adds scopes to all vanilla bows making them look much more epic. Some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19495">compatibility patches</a> are available, as well as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16666">VR patch</a>.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9253">BillyRo Ultimate Swords Anthology <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        The massive pack containing dozens of amazing standalone weapons by talented Billyro, ported from Skyrim LE.

        Small pack of weapons from another talented weapon mods author, pretty similar to Billyro's style in general.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5306">Katana Crafting <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14316">Isilmeriel LOTR Weapons Collection</a>
        Old but good weapon pack for LOTR fans. Also install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25105">fix patch</a> needed to correct some errors made during mod porting from Skyrim LE.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17382">The Witcher 3 Weaponry</a>
        Simple as that. Great mod for Witcher series fans and fitting Skyrim world.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19598">Tera Weapons with Leveled List</a>
        Definitely not lore-friendly, MMO-like weapons, but may be interesting for some players.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15050">Kthonia's Unique Weapon Pack - Dragonborn Weapons <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5609">Skyforge Weapons</a>

        For increadibly qualitative weapons mods if you want them standalone out of the pack linked above, or if you just wanna endorse his original works ;) Note that he has vastly less mods officially for SE than for LE - most you need to port yourself if you want to have them standalone.

      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138">Zim's Immersive Artifacts</a>
        I'd say an essential mod - a massive overhaul to more than 50 artifacts. It improves and rebalances huge amount of unique named items in the game, finally making them worth to hunt for and keep even at high levels and not thworing them to trash bin insantly after you found your first dragonbone weapon or daedric armor. SIC <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15897">patch</a>, WACCF <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19489">patch</a> and Wintersun <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24228">patch</a> are available, as well as tiny visual <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19623">addon</a>.

        Similar mod from the Legacy of the Dragonborn author which is focusing on thane rewards only, making the really unique. You can also install the patch (look in files section) from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9849?tab=files">this patches collection</a> to use it together with Zim's Immersive Artifacts.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8832">True Artifacts of Skyrim <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        A similar to Zim's work and imo, pretty underrated mod (obviously not compatible with previous one, choose one or another) with own approach, which covers a hundred!! of artifacts.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9865">The Gifts of Akatosh</a>
        One of my most favourite weapon and armor packs. Epic, detailed and lore-friendly.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17632">Noldor Content Pack <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        Another great LOTR-inspired armor/weapon pack. That's a version with a small fix, so please make sure to endorse the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5606">original mod</a> (you don't need it though).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8856">DCR - King Crusader Mega Pack</a>
        Badass, grim, beautiful pack of armor (somewhat inspired by nazguls from LOTR to me), swords and a unique spell.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4253">Dragon Carved Armor Set</a>
        Heavy armor set + weapons, looking epic and pretty much immersive. Some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15672">recolors</a> are available. Also install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19283">patch</a> if you're experiencing floating armor, but before installing, rename the "Mesh" folder to "Meshes".
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16199">Artifacts - The Breton Paladin</a>
        Beautiful paladin armor set, including an extra helmet, sword, mace, warhammer and ring.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17510">Resplendent Armor and Greatsword <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        One of my favourite armor/weapon mods ever made. Heavily-inspired by Arthorias from DS series. You may also be interested in this retexture for it.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18966">Imperial Dragonknight Armory <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        Very cool looking and original mashup of Iron and Blades armor sets.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644">Oblivion Artifact Pack</a>
        Adds various unique weapons and armor pieces from The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion into Skyrim. Such as the Escutcheon of Chorrol, The Redwave, Blackwater Blade, Draconian Madstone And many more.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2687">Aetherium Armor and Weapons Compilation <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14409">Vikings Weaponry</a>
        Highly-immersive set of nordic weapons and shields in just insane quality. I also highly recommend to browse the profile of this author - he has a lot of other mods (mostly new weapons) - unlike this mod, most of other his weapons are not lore-friendly and mostly inspired by Warcraft, but their quality is absolutely amazing.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13375">Somewhat Historically Accurate Weapons and Viking Gear</a>
        A port of same LE mods - the name pretty much stands for it :) Adds new weapons (mostly) and some armors.

      <p>Skyrim modding stage is litereally swarmed by follower mods, the vastly majority of which are really dull and simply briefly imported racemenu presets with nothing more. That's why I decided I can't skip this part and show you some really worthy follower mods - interesting, funny, badass, with own temper and/or unique look, background stories and personal questlines and so on. Using mods from this section you will be sure your companions are not only "I'm sworn to carry your burdens".</p>
      <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <p class="text_yellow">First of all, a few great mods to give you immensely better control over your followers in all aspects and make your life with followers much more comfortable"</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7003">EFF - Extensible Follower Framework</a>
        Grab this mod if you will ever play with followers. It's amazing and complex mod that adds many features to skan, control, equip your followers, give them much more commands, teleport to you if they are stuck or lost and much, much more. With a cool UI in addition! Note: take into account that some complex follower mods, line INIGO, for example, are not compatible with EFF. That doesn't mean your game will crash or something. They just mostly have own customized controls system, so just use it and don't try to manage them with EFF, otherwise they may act weird.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18076">Nether's Follower Framework</a>
        A great alternative to previous mod, without some features of it, but with some of own unique features.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20227">My Home is Your Home (MHiYH 2plus)</a>
        This mod will be useful as well if you like to play with many followers or just to have many of them in overall and choose different companions from time to time.
        <p class="text_yellow">Now let's get to the followers themselves - the most interesting, funny, beautiful, charismatic and badass companions you can have:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461">INIGO</a>
        The one brave khajiit to rule them all. The one companion to pun them all. In my opinion, Inigo, while having not the numerically biggest amount of endorsments, is the best follower mod ever made. If you never liked to play with followers and even if you hate followes/follower mods in principle, Inigo will change that once and forever after just a couple of hours played together with him. Or maybe even after a few minutes.<br>
        Inigo is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over seven thousands lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He doesn't just have some "on-call phrase" - he reacts on everything and everyone around you. He will comment, he will sing, he will scream, he will joke and he will troll. Both you and your followers as well. Inigo is one of those mods that make you give a complete new look on the game.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2180">Sofia - The Funny Fully Voiced Follower</a>
        "The infamous Sofia needs little introduction as she causes trouble across Skyrim". And that's all about her. The very original, funny and sarcastic follower voiced by professional voice actress.<br>
        Sofia is quite an unusual follower. She is tough, witty and just a little bit boastful. She has a strong fondness for the player character but her deliberate attempts to disguise the fact just leads to very awkward conversations especially as she usually says exactly what she thinks. Sofia is a tease and loves to wind people up which doesn’t make her very popular with people. Her rebellious spirit and careless attitude often gets her in trouble. Not to mention her constant inappropriate comments which easily offend or embarrass people. Also take a look at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7582">customizer addon</a> for her.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3231858?tab=user+files&amp;BH=2#">Elianora profile</a>
        ﻿That's with no doubts a first profile you may want to look at when it comes to player homes. Elianora is a godess of player homes, simple as that. She is specializing mostly on small and cozy player homes of absolutely various styles - so in her profile you most likely will find a mod for no matter what character type you are playing as. You may also be interested in this little <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5474">addon</a> for it.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> unfortunately, Elianora has just a few of her mods for Skyrim SE, while having almost 60 for Skyrim LE. You have either to try convert the mods from LE you like yourself, or just consider playing LE which is once again having vastly more mods available.

        While designed for a mage character initially, this amazing magic tower can actually serve as an epic base for anyone (but ofc without magic skills at all it will be very hard to complete its questline). Yes-yes, questline. It's not just a tower - it's like a complete new world inside it. It offers features never seen before, customisation, and is more than just a player home. The tower must be restored through a Hearthfire style crafting system or you can simply purchase everything you need. This mod is also based heavily around player choice.

      <div class="center_img"><img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/LtfSHU1.png" alt=""></div>
      <p>Combat &amp; stealth, perks &amp; spells, AI &amp; animations, creatures &amp; factions. Different overhauls and improvements - everything that affects your game variety and difficulty. There is one general Skyrim issue that (thank you Bethesda) wasn't changed at all from LE to SE. Skyrim script engine, Papyrus. It's static in terms of how many scripts it can handle, and this can not be expanded by any means (unlike the video memory limitations for Skyrim LE, for example), it can not be fixed or changed and it doesn't depend on 32bit or 64bit, our your PC specs - at all. Consider Papyrus a bottle which can handle only X amount of water. When it's X+1 or more - scripts are started being cluttered in your save file instead. This generally causes so called "script lag", save bloats, and, eventually, a broken game, and as mentioned before, the fact Skyrim SE is 64bit game doesn't give any benefits. So when it comes to gameplay mods (most of which have scripts in this or that amount), you need to be same careful in SE. Now, a quick manual of "how to see if my game can handle more script-heavy mods":</p>
      <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <p>To test if your game overloaded with scripts or not, is very easy.When you are like starting to feel you have plenty of gameplay mods already, and not sure if your game can handle something like Frostfall, or two more combat mods etc - don't worry. Install them.</p>
        <p>Then, launch your game and make NEW SAVE. While you'll be testing the game, save ONLY on that slot.</p>
        <p>Now, go and force game to script-heavy situations. Go and fight bandits in some polulated fort, visit few big cities, run here and there. Visit locations with stormy weathers, and ofc, make actions that are depending on the mod you have just installed (like, build the camp if it's Frostfall, or change your clothings several times etc).</p>
        <p>Game running fine? No stutters in combat or actions, no crashes? (Exactly stutters - short-time game freezes, not the regular fps drops). Great! You're good to go. Stutters/crashes appear in combat, populated cities, during certain scripted actions? Nope. This mod is overloading your game - skip it.</p>
        <p>And don't forget to delete the "test" save after.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="center_img"><img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/kFEBa35.png" alt=""></div>

        I have no idea how I missed adding this mod in the initial 2.0 release. Silly me. That's a great mod to add plenty of new animals, both predators and non-aggressive ones, to your game. Don't forget to grab a SkyTEST patch for it at integration project files page ;)
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723">Deadly Dragons</a>
        Adds 14 new dragons and unique skills to them. Adds amazing dragon ‘assault’ system. Via MCM menu you can configure dragons stats - health, damage and much more. Must-have one. Also look here for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24933">Splendor patch</a>.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695">Diverse Dragons Collection</a>
        Amazing mod that adds 28 new beautiful dragons to game, with 7 ranks for each dragon type, 16 new breath attacks and 19 new abilities. Greatly configurable MCM menu. Compatible with all dragon mods. My personal recommendation - it’s a great addition for other dragons mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24788">Chaos Dragons</a>
        Mod adds 45 new unique dragons to game. It’s similar to Deadly Dragons/DDC, but much less lore-friendly. It’s compatible with dragon AI mods, BUT not compatible with Deadly Dragons so you’ll need to choose.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670">Splendor - Dragon Variants</a>
        Simply a must-have mod, no matter which your "dragon" mod setup is. Drastically increases the visual diversity of enemy dragons, while using only vanilla resources, ending with 784 possible combinations. Fully compatible with other dragon mods
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5404">Beasts of Tamriel</a>
        Awesome mod that adds dozens of new creatures, both monsters and critters - some are not much lore-friendly, but every creature in the mod can be disabled through MCM. If you’re looking for even more expansion of your creatures variety, try it! Also install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18358">this patch</a> to prevent several possible crashes from appearing, plus there's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18740">INEED patch</a> available.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12650">Simple Horse</a>
        While being much more stable then Convinient Horses, Immersive Horses is still pretty script-heavy - so if that matters for your mod list and you still want better horses functionality, but even more lightweght one - pick this neat little mod from author of Ultimate Combat and TK Dodge.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13343">One With Nature - Dynamic Animals and Creatures</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145">OBIS - Organized Bandits In Skyrim</a>
        Definitely best bandits mod. It adds amazing variety of bandits (about 2500!! in total), dozens of bandit factions. Bandits are groupped, positioned, have unique skills and improved AI. There are also optional plugins, for example, plugin that will add bandit raids around the towns and villages. My personal recommendation. Cloaks of Skyrim <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26766">patch</a> is available separately.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> don't use OBIS and Immersive Patrols togehter - while being 100% stable and great mods themselves, when used together, sooner or later they case a game-breaking bug when random factions start attacking you on sight with no reason. I'm personally using OBIS.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10552">OBIS Loot</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004">Immersive College of Winterhold</a>
        This mod a must-have. Yes, even if you're playing not as pure mage. You still will go through College questline sooner or later, and you still will be visiting it from time to time. This mod is just enormous in it's College overhaul aspect. Aesthetical visual overhaul of structures and building, new buildings, new cells, new dungeon, greatly improved College NPCs AI, new NPCs, immersive magic learning expirience, new dungeon, quest and dozens of other tiny details - feel this faction as never before. Also take a look at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18275">map texture improvement</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23630">chains improvement</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23361">"3D" Trees patch</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18731">No So Fast Mage Guild patch</a>

        Ever wonder why Fort Dawnguard is so damned depressing? You arrive and the place is empty and uninspiring. Dark, old, worn down, tattered banners, and only a wet-behind-the-ears farmboy with "pa's axe" to greet you when you arrive - well, this mod changes that.

        <p class="text_yellow">First, let's see some magic-related mods that are improving spellcasting/learning experience in this or that way:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7037">Visual Animated Enchants - VAE</a>
        A replacer for the visual and animation of the enchantments on weapons to make them more magical and immersive. Also install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24665">fix</a> for it, also choosing needed patched in FOMOD installer.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20983">Spell Research <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/SWjYqZD.png" alt=""></a>
        Maybe the most interesting and unique mod of that type, and absolutely original. Adds a completely new system to research and discover spells from any supported spell mod. As well as adding an in-built spell tome and scroll crafting system, a Victorian-Era style alchemy system, where you can decompose items, and mix or analyze the resultant solutions, and expands the lore of magic with dozens of texts and artifacts to find. In this mod, spells are not simple mixtures of cantrips or effects, but each spell is a completely unique piece of art, and each mage casts each spell slightly differently. Instead of studying what spells are 'made' of, you study how to manipulate and invoke magic. This system is told in terms of Archetypes, the elements and techniques you need to understand in order to cast spells. You can discover and study these elements and techniques through several ways. You can spend several in-game days studying your own spells in a comfortable tower. You can decompose and analyze the tons of ingredients you have stored. Or you can go out to find and study ancient text, tomes, and artifacts.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> Spell Research mod page recommends to use Better Spell Learning mod, which indeed is a great one in Skyrim LE, but is very bugged and often causes crashes in Skyrim SE. Use it at your own risk.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22139">No Spell Tomes as Loot or From Vendors <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        Removes most spell tomes from leveled lists, in case you have an alternate method of obtaining them. A great realism addition for Spell Research.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17446">Spell Learning and Discovery</a>
        Lightweight and configurable mod that prevens player form learning spells instantly, making player to study them by spending some ingame time. Mod also has other cool features like increased chances to learn spells the mor spells you casted, chances of learning about new spell when talking to mages and so on. compatible with spell mods.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25793">Dragonborn Ascendant</a>
        Awesome and criminally underrated mod. It’s main feature is boost to shouts cooldown per dragon killed (3% per 5 dragons, capped at 30%) Mod also balances and improves many shouts values and scales battle shouts damage each 10 levels. Don't use together with previous mod, choose one or another.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20754">Spellsword</a>
        Sword or magic, why to choose? Install this mod and be able to launch prepared spells with weapon swings. Note: Ordinator has several spellsword perks and one of the perks is making almost literally the same, so if you're running Ordinator - you don't need this one for playing as spellsword character.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8374">Awakened Magicka</a>
        Simple but effective magic overhaul. Note: you don't need need if you're planning to use big perk overhauls like Ordinator or Path of Sorcery.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27110">No Force for Illusion Magic <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        <p class="text_yellow">Now, the spell mods themselves:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090">Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim</a>
        The biggest and greatest spells mod in history. While adding 155 new spells it’s still really well balanced and immersive. Absolutely any player will find something useful here - just for damage or for the immersive roleplay. It’s also very compatible with other magic/perk mods. You may use or not use another mods with it but  you just must use this one :) One of my two most favourite spellpacks for Skyrim. Don't foget to grab Ordinator/Vokrii patch depending on which one you're using.

        A lot of them. This said, may of these arrows can make you pretty OP, especially when playing with perk overhauls, so use with caution. Moreover, fully-functional elemental arrows are implemented in Ordinator. Yet ofc, you may like exactly this mod as it adds vastly bigger variety of them :)
        <p class="text-center">You can also look on the spell mods I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/sMsjIsoS37M">personally using in my ultimate mod list</a>, but take into account it's for LE and unfortunately you won't be able to have your game looking the same visually and having 100% of the same mods.</p>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1473">Modern Brawl Bug Fix</a>
        This is not an overhaul by any means, but a bugfixing mod. The reason why it's listed in the beginning of this section is because it's included in major Enai Siaion mods like Ordinator or Vokrii, so you don't need it if using them. But if you will be not using them - isntall it.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137">Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim</a>
        The one perk overhaul to rule'em'all! Mod that offers more then 400 perks to improve your game expirience and class bulding. To tell this is a great perk overhaul - means to tell nothing. It’s rich, brilliant and absolutely perfect for both dedicated character skills building and roleplay. To make sure just visit mod page and read a few perks description. In addition to this it’s extremely light-weight compared to other perk overhaul mods and also greatly compatible with everything. If it’s your first try of perk overhauls - try it and you’ll enjoy it. If you’re using another similar mod - switch to Ordinator and you won’t go back. Perk overhauls are absolutely matter of taste, but this one’s quality is just amazing. ‘How much did Enai Siaion pay you?’ - you may ask. I would also ask this, yes. Until I try this amazing mod. Even if you open comments section and see what people often write, you’ll see that many players switched from other perk overhauls and don’t want to go back. Of course, it’s only my personal opinion, but statistics don’t lie and one thing you definitely need to do is to try it :)<br>
        Additionally, when using Ordinator, my series of unique modded character builds is fully available to you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqzmxRrbyviMR1A_1NNITQYQgHqmYDVg5">here</a> (13 builds available atm).

        You can call this "Ordinator-lite", a mod from the same author. Smaller and "simplier", while still adding depth and replayability. I personally find the complexity and variety of Ordinator perks its biggest advantage, which allows that insane amount of creative character builds - but if you want something simplier, Vokrii can be a good hit. Also take a look at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26278">patches insaller <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> which adds support for some popular mods, and there's also a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26375">CACO patch <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6660">Path of Sorcery - Magic Perk Overhaul</a>
        Awesome magic per overhaul. It affects Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Enchanting, Illusion, and Restoration trees. The one disadvantage is it’s incompatible with some big and well-known perk overhauls, like SkyRE/Requiem/SPERG. But as it is developed only for mage perk trees and you play as mage you can simply choose to use this mod only. Also it’s compatible with Ordinator, so you can use both of them - just load this mod after Ordinator. To choose perk overhaul it’s absolutely matter of taste - so you are free to try them all anyway :) There patches for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6702">Apocalypse and Immersive Sounds <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> available, as well as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6684">patch <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> for Elemental Destruction Magic.

        One of two greatest vampire mods evern made. Mod gives a wide overhaul for vampires. Perks and skills improvements, new skills, expanded system of vampire needs, blood storage system and much more. Also you can grab this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19241">cosmetic addon <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> for it.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928">Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim</a>
        The second of the two greatest vampire mods and my personal favourite. Sacrosanct overhauls vampires and vampire lords. Reverse progression (stronger when fed), new abilities, powers, perks, hemomancy, various new progression systems, personal vampire questline and many gameplay tweaks for the discerning undead monster. It's main advantage over is while being absolutely revolutionary and all-embracing, it's very lightweight at the same time, and very easy to get used to all new features. Note: do not use both Sacrosacnt and Better Vampires. Choose one. Tehnically, they can be used together (patch available on BV page), but in this case many of Sacrosanct major features will be cut off. You can also take a look on 2 small tweaks for it <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10174">here <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25684">here <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16561">Lupine - Werewolf Perk Expansion</a>
        A new and absolutely badass werefolf perk overhaul which introduces absolutely new unique features, like two possible werevolf paths, completely new howls, looting as werevolf, werevolf armor etc.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2235">Bloodmoon Rising</a>
        Another, old but great werewolf mod that overhauls werewolf perks and stats. If you like to play as werewolf you should know that werewolf became wery weak versus high lelel enemies. Mod helps with this. Use this OR Lupine, not both.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10859">ASIS</a>
        ASIS is very underrated mod and its functionality is pretty often miunderstood by players.
        Asis is a must-have mod for interesting and challenging playthrough. I personally advise to use ASIS only for 3 features: perks and spells distribution to NPC and NPC potion usage. That's the main amazing feature of ASIS - mods like perk overhauls, spell packs and so on, are either not adding possibility for NPCs to acces new perks and spells, or giving that on a very basic level, eventually making you more and more OP. Here where ASIS changes the game - it gives this access to NPCs. With this you can have an amazing game where all new spells/perks from mod could be used by NPCs as well as potions. It’s AI option is pretty old and i don’t recommend to use it because modern combat mods have better AI improvements. Also it’s not needed to use its increased spawn features as this feature is buggy as hell and cuases random crashes, plus it's completely illogical. But if you will not check the spawns options in patcher - you'll be totally safe. So once again, I recommend to use ASIS with 3 features: perks, spells &amp; potions. Also, don’t forget to run ASIS patcher each time you installed mod that adds spells/perks. Patcher is located in \Data\Skyproc Patchers\ASIS\ASIS.jar
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15686">Dwemer Certified</a>
        Don't just let those broken Dwemer Constructs and spare Dwemer Ingots go to waste- use them to build an army of steam-powered robots, upgrade and enchant their equipment, then lead them into battle from the driver's seat of a Dwemer Centurion.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/321">Ars Metallica - Smithing Enhancement</a>
        Pretty old, but good mod until Complete Crafting Overhaul is officially released for SE. Adds the ability to forge arrows, gain skill for smelting and mining, melt down unwanted armor and weapons etc.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315">Imperious - Races of Skyrim</a>
        Awesome mod that overhauls Skyrim races abilities, from the author of Ordinator. Now each race has 3 passive abilities and ultimate active ability that can be unlocked through race quest. That also bring more immersion to playthrough. New races abilities are interesting and fit perfectly with each race.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14910">Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim</a>
        Mod replaces the default standing stone effects with tactical and interesting new powers and abilities. Each standing stone comes with one passive ability and one active power. While greatly increasing standing stones effects variety, mod is still balanced and great for immersive playthrough. Also a tiny <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20939">tweak <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> for it is available.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686">Aetherius - A Race and Standing Stone Overhaul</a>
        A more simple alternative to Imperious/Andromeda together. Some of the bonuses are somewhat OP, but you can adjust that through xEdit easily.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751">Experience</a>
        A complete overhaul to expirience system in Skyrim transforming it to classic RPG style. Compatible with mods as well. Gain expirience by completing quests, exploring wilderness, clearning dungeons and forts, killing enemies and so on.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24296">Archery Gameplay Overhaul</a>
        Popular and great archery mod. It adds great amount of features: - dozens of animations. - enchanted arrows - new bow camera mod - arm fatigue - really, really many overall archery improvements that make archer/hunter gameplay more interesting and realistic.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058">MorrowLoot Ultimate</a>
        In-depth and, in my opinion, simply essential mod. It makes a complete rebalances of various game aspects, making it to play more similar to Morrowind leveled lists and leveling system - rare items like daedric or dwarven are REALLY rare now so you will not see each 2nd bandit in daedric gear when you'll reach lvl 80, enemies level scaling is much more balanced and challenging, and so on - many other mechanics such as leveling and alchemy were changed as well. Note: this is also the only "flaw" of this mod - it's too complex and will have compatibility issues with similar mods. That's why I'm personally using the "simplified" version of it, look below.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2295">MUS - Morrowloot Ultimate Simplified</a>
        This version only rebalances rare items, loot and quest rewards - which is making it a perfect solution in terms of compatibility and still keeping the main feature of the mod. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14022">ISC patch <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> available.

        Deleveled gameplay fans, this mod is for you. It's designed to decentralize the player from the world. This is a fairly in-depth deleveling but basically loot and enemy difficulty will increase based on location and type. Yet, the introduced difficulty is somewhat artificial, as it changes mostly juts the enemies stats and level. But once again, taste is taste :)

        <p class="text_yellow">First of all, let's look on some great mods that are affecting enemies in general - their AI, skills, leveling and so on - everyting to make your enemies really worth a fight, a challenging opponents:</p>
        <p><span class="note_pink">Note:</span> as for the first 4 mods, you should choose one of the to use - don't use tem together.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3231">High Level Enemies</a>
        Simple but effective, old but good enemy mod - it places almost 900 new high-level enemies across Skyrim for much mroe challenging gameplay at any levels which are logically placed and will gradually appear starting from lvl 10. For those who are aimed on hardcore, long walkthrough, its "HLE - Increased Max Resists" plugin is also recommended.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> if you're using Skyrim Immersive Creatures mod, use its own <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680?tab=files">modified version of this mod</a>, namely the "High Level Enemies SIC SE Edition" file.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598">Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemy Overhaul</a>
        A really well-rounded overhaul - neither too boring or too hardcore. It's focuced on harder bossfights and more variative enemies in general - some new higher leveled enemies here and there, enemies getting new spells from popular mods like Apocalypse and Shadow Spell Package and so on. Leveled bosses <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27201">patch <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> is available for better challenge.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2969">Revenge Of the Enemies</a>
        My personal favourite between similar enemy mods, with the biggest coverage, creativity and most challenging effect. It improves enemis AI, scales ebemies level with yours, give unique skills to each enemy type, gives them strong cooperation and so on. Also the great advantage is that it’s very-light-weight and almost scriptless. Once again, it's pretty hardcore - so if you're aimed on semi-casual gameplay, it may be not for you (but you also can try the easier version), but if you want your game to be reall challenging - you'll find no better candidate. After you'll see master vampires actually teleporting using the swarm of bats form, and fight some bosses (both improved vanilla bosses and new added ones), it will be hard to trade this for other mod. But once again, it's about your personal taste. There are also some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9597">patches <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> for popular mods available as well as well as mentioned <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19543">easier version</a> of it.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6843">Advanced Adversary Encounters - Ultimate</a>
        Similar mod with a different approach. It focuses mostly not on unique enemies abilities and skills, but on adding more realistic resistances. Skeletons are very resistant to arrows, automatons are very resistant to sharp weapons, shock and fire spells, but weak to ice spells, and so on. The flaw of this mod is that enemies, in terms of own actions and skill, are mostly very similar to vanilla and even with realistic resistances, fights may often be not much challenging. But if you wanna "vanilla plus realism" experience, this mod may be a great variant. Also has dedicated <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7038">patches page <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> - don't forget to grab the patches you need.
        <p class="text_yellow">Good.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13807">Know Your Enemy - Trait-based resistances and weaknesses</a>
        This original mod changes the both resistances and weaknesses of creatures and armor to magic and physical damage enhancing combat challenge and variety (similar to what AAE does, but with a more complex approach) - not just giving one bigger resistance and one weakness, but assigning a wide system of creature types, each with several different resistances/weaknesses, and a single creature may be a multiple type one. The best part is it's highly compatible with all 4 "big" mods above, combat mods, and most of gameplay mods in general. There is new features <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24043">addon <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> and Elemental Destruction Magic <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22254">patch <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510">Better Vampire NPCs</a>
        They will be leveled according to the PC and get stronger with advanced perks, spells, and all new abilities. Vampires can now be many different classes: one or two handed, light armor, heavy armor, mage, light bowman, heavy crossbowman. More variety, more challenge, more fun. Note: all "big" 4 enemy overhauls are also covering vampires, so load this mod after if you want its changes to have the upper hand.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775">Draugr Upgrades and Improvements</a>
        Real armor effect for draugrs and not just visuals, new perks, new types of draugrs etc. Note: all "big" 4 enemy overhauls are also covering draugrs, so load this mod after if you want its changes to have the upper hand. A <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26939">patch</a> for Skyrim Revamped is available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15541">Simply Balanced</a>
        This mod can be take as a successor of well-known SkyTweak and is a port of same LE mod. Basically, it allows you to customize pretty much close to every gameplay value - weapons, magic, potions &amp; poisons, skills, enemy stats and experience gains. To say more precise, if you have your load order setup precizely and know every mod is working in a good synergy - you won't need this mod. But if you're not sure about some balance moments, or just wanna to be able to customize your gameplay difficulty through wide system of parameters - grab it for sure.
        <p class="text_yellow">Naisu! Now let's go to other interesting gameplay mods.</p>

        This mod restores a lot of  content that was created but never implemented in the original game - quests, NPCs, building and other different little things. RS Children <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8753">patch, </a><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5732">lighting overhaul</a>, higher quality tintmarks <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18390">addon</a> and a tiny <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2723">fix</a> are available.

Besides that, Uncapper does tons of oher useful things - you can determine leveling speed (strongly recommened to make it slower to not get lost on huge amount of new things in game if you have heavy-modded game), how many attributes you receive per at levelup (and at which level as well), how many perk points you receive at levelup (and at which level as well) and many other things.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12885">Honed Metal</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16190">Signature Equipment</a>
        Pretty original mod that may be very useful for some players, especially in roleplay purposes. The more you use the same equipment, the more potent and valuable that equipment becomes. It's a lot like tempering, but you do it by cleaving through your enemies gradually. This allows for a favorite early game weapon to become a signature weapon that scales with your character. Maybe your character might intentionally build up the reputation of a weapon to sell it for a profit. Or maybe you like the way a weapon looks, but its damage just can't keep up. That's no longer an issue now. It's also compatible will all possible weapon mods on fly.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5260">Better Skill and Quest Books Names</a>
        Not that much "immersive", but definitely may look useful for some players.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16588">Holdable Candles <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        A small mod designed for stealth characters using extremely dark interiors from ENB or weather presets. The candle illuminates a small area in front of the player, thus allowing the player to see items in front of them to steal, and avoiding the use of a torch (lighting up the entire room and increasing the risk of being detected).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4851">Altar of the Revenant <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        Bethesda likes to screw up more things in newer versions of the games than in older ones. This helps a bit in this certain case.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8492">Selective and-or More Expensive Transmute <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15545">Soul Exchange</a>
        Sadly, Dragon Soul Relinquishment mod is pretty bugged in SE. This is a simple alternative to it. Mod allows you to convert Dragon Souls to Perks or Attributes.

        Not much realistic mod, but may be useful to casual players.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26979">Intoxication (Drunk and Drugged visual effects) <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        Simple as that. Some big mods like CACO already adding such effect, but if you're not using them and just wanna the visual effect - grab this mod.

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1525">Combat Evolved</a>
        Light-weight, script-free, old-but-good combat mod. Due to its great compatibility it can be used alongside with other combat mods for even better combat expirience. Enemies are more agressive and smarter. Stagger, knockdown, enemy skills, and enemy damage are enhanced. But at the same time enemies are not ‘terminators’ - mod is good balanced. I strongly recommend to use it. I also advise to use modular version for more detailed installation process.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17196">Ultimate Combat <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/SWjYqZD.png" alt=""></a>
        Amazing combat mod that brings you totally new combat expirience. Enemies AI isnow better, they can cooperate, parry, dodge, counter your attacks as well as having unique special spells and abilities. Mod modifies many combat stats for more realistic combat. Mod also adds timed block feature, stamina cost for regular attacks, headshots for archers (can be configured in MCM menu) and some even more things. Try it for sure!
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368">Wildcat - Combat of Skyrim</a>
        New combat mod from the author of Apocalypse/Ordinator. This amazing mod makes combat more realistic, dynamic and brings more lethality into your game. Mod ipmroves combat AI that makes enemies more smart, initiative and dangerous. It’s biggest and greatest (in my opinion) feature is wide injures system. It’s really realistic and simple at the same time. It also modifies global difficulty levels in Skyrim and gives you possibility to configure these values in MCM menu. It also offers timed block feature as well as many other combat modifiers. It’s also pretty good compatible with all combat/magic/ perk overhaul mods and mod author also inlcuded detailed load order description list for this/that mod. Immersive Movement <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15649">patch</a> is available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14904">TK HitStop</a>
        This is a great mod for combat immersion. Ever asked yourself why weapon weights nothing? Why your character doesn’t feel any physics after swinging two-handed battleaxe? Then this mod is for you. When the player hits an actor or an object, a “hit-stop” (a tiny pause) is added along with camera shake and blur effects. This makes weapon strikes feel more solid and heightens the sense that a hit has actually been made.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14905">TK Recoil</a>
        This mod is similar to previous one, just for the bows/crossbows. When the player shot a bow or crossbow or staff, a "recoil" (a tiny pause) is added along with camera shake and blur effects. This makes weapon recoil feel more solid and heightens the sense that a hit has actually been made. Mod also comes with an MCM menu.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15309">TK Dodge</a>
        Very popular and must-have mod if you’re running several combat mods that increase game difficulty. Mod adds dodge rolls (forward-back-left-right) using hotkeys. Mod also has an MCM menu where you can re-configure the hotkeys and dodge roll stamina cost. Xbox One gamepad <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14982">addon</a> available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4881">Mortal Enemies <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        Remember how NPCs can turn to your direction just in the middle of weapon swing? Forget about this! Elemental Destruction Magic <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27222">patch <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a> available.

        Simple as that. Decreases hit range for all melee weapons to be more realistic.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16767">Reasonable Reloading</a>
        Manual crowssbow reloading mod, fully customizable in MCM.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20783">Weapon Arts</a>
        This mod adds to Skyrim weapon-arts (or weapon-skills), which are based on equipped weapon type and its enchantment. If player character has enough magicka, then using a lesser power added by the mod (Z button), the combat skill with special effects and animations will be performed.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18086">Simple Lock-On</a>
        Mod adds a simple target lock feature in combat. Some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18138">reticle replacers</a> are available.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18264">(SJG) Dual Wield Parrying Reimplementation</a>
        Simple parry mod for dual wielding/spellcasting.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25960">ArrowBlock(REAL Deflect Arrow) <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        This mod allows you to block arrows and magic projectiles with your weapon or shield which will cost you some stamina/magicka. For making mod better balanced, I'd recommend to raise this cost value using xEdit, itherwise you can be near to invincible often for too low cost.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17581">Wounds</a>
        Simple mod focused exactly on injuries. More realistic/hard to heal comparing to Wildcat's injuries system (you should not use them both or disable WC injuries if you want this one, otherwise it will become messy).
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17400">Critical Hit - Backstab and Parry in Skyrim</a>
        Little, but just a badass mod that adds DS-like backstab and parry to the game. All damage multipliers can be adjusted in MCM.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12631">Disarmless <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        I personally always enjoyed this enemy ability, but if this bothers you - mod removes Disarm shout from either draugrs only, or the entire game including mods.
        <p class="text-center">You can also look on the combat mods I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/4nqKChF4NcY">personally using in my ultimate mod list</a>, but take into account it's for LE and unfortunately you won't be able to have your game looking the same visually and having 100% of the same mods.</p>

        <p class="text_yellow">Let's start from a most (deservedly) known, complex and simply epic alchemy overhaul, which is close to be an essential mod for almost any walkthrough.</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924">Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul</a>
        Amazing mod that completely overhauls Alchemy and Cooking. Alchemy has a great potential in Skyrim, but at the same time it was the most boring profession. And now CACO saves the day! Besides awesome overhauls mod even offers you to craft alchemical bombs as well as waxes, salves and bandages. You can also use field alchemy stuff to make potions &amp; poisons anywhere you want. CACO also offfers basic needs and even inebriation effects. It has MCM menu and most of new features can be configured and turned off if you don’t need them.
        <span class="text_yellow">Patches:</span>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19518">Kryptopyr's Patch Hub</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5877">Alchemy Potions and Food Adjustments</a>
        Mod can be take as "lite" version of CACO (use one or another, not both). Improves the consistency and balance of alchemy and potions in general as well as correcting some cheat-like features present in vanilla.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12343">Skyrim Alchemy and Food Overhaul</a>
        Another simple but good alternative, oriented on somewhat hardcore gameplay.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9070">Cooking In Skyrim</a>
        Simple, but still great cooking mod. Use one or another, it's not compatible with CACO.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13368">Poisoning Extended</a>
        A simple but revolutionary mod that allows you to poison your weapons multiple times to not make this annoying "menu-poison-back to game" action after each swing or shot and to actually see which exactly poison is applied and how many stacks left via cozy UI.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13153">Skytoxin - Realistic Dangerous Poison <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        Potions and poisons get more realistic and dangerous. Great for roleplaying and survival.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22776">Toxicity - A Witcher-like Toxicity System</a>
        Mod puts a soft limit on the number of potions that could be consumed at once. Drinking too many potions will cause your toxicity level to rise and will eventually cause you to lose your balance and produce hallucinations in the form of visual effects. It's also compatible with everything out of the box.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27952">Potion Tolerance <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        A more simple and "forgiving" yet immersive alternative to previous mod to make potions usage less "spamming" and more realistic, introducing sort of alchemical diminishing. While under the effect of potions, your tolerance will gradually increase, decreasing the effectiveness of subsequent potions. Tolerance will gradually return to normal after all alchemical effects wear off.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2961">Alchemist Compendium <img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png" alt=""></a>
        Another simple yet immersive mod. Mod adds a reference book, listing all Skyrim ingredients and their 4 effects. No more blind experimenting and wasting expensive ingredients on failed potions. Now you can look up the ingredient in your reference book in you inventory like a real student. On the other hand, this may also be somewhat cheating/"spoiler'ish" to some players, so use ot your own preference.

      <p>More enemies, more sudden encounters, more civil war battles, more neutral NPCs as well. Please remember: big amount of population mods together with heavy-modded gameplay setup may overload your game and cause instability and script lags. To avoid this - install population mods one by one and check your performance ingame, testing affected areas like cities, forts or faction battles.</p>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/718">Immersive Patrols</a>
        One of the most popular mods at Nexus. And it absolutely deserved this. Mod adds really immersive patrols of almost every major faction across 
        all DLCs, including Stormcloaks, Thalmor, Imperials, Dawnguard, Travelers, Merchants, Bandits, Skaal, Redoran, Reavers and Rieklings. You will see small and bigger faction battles and even for sieges in absolutely each region of Skyrim! It’s also don’t use scripts - so you can install and uninstall it anytime without any worries and it’s pretty good compatible with almost everything. There's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23774">"stripped down" version of the plugin</a> (overwrite the original mod plugin with it) that has 2 versions - without merchants and leveled lists changes or with this and without war zones on top.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> don't use OBIS and Immersive Patrols togehter - while being 100% stable and great mods themselves, when used together, sooner or later they case a game-breaking bug when random factions start attacking you on sight with no reason. I'm personally using OBIS.

Long story short, it's everything that makes your game realistic (i.e. similar to real life) in some way - needs system, camping, weather affecting character warmth and health, realistic physical abilities, AI packages and so on. Everything to make you feel not just playing a character in game, but to "feel" this game better and have better interaction with the world around you.</p>

        <p class="text_yellow">First of all, the Campfire and Frostfall section. Those 2 mods are like a pillars for survival experience in Skyrim, and also have plenty of addons/patches for them (partially because sadly, both have plenty of bugs in SE version while LE versions are much more clean, so some additional adjustments are needed to make them working fine).</p>
        <p><span class="note_pink">Note:</span> Frostfall [requires] Campfire, but you are not obligated to use both - you can just use Campfire for camping things.</p>

        Realistic survival expirience? Best immersion mod even created? Think no more. Look at Frostfall. Absolutely amazing survival expirience. Cold water, frosty winds, snow, low temperatures - everyting these now affect your health condition. Frostfall uses a sophisticated system to track your location, weather, time of day, worn clothing, and more, to determine your current condition, in a seamless and immersive way. Combined with Campfire, it also features a large variety of craftable camping equipment, including craftable torches. It is highly customizable, and very compatible with most other mods, including Real Shelter, Climates of Tamriel, Wet and Cold, worn cloaks, food, timescale, lighting, werewolf, and vampire mods.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> if you never played any kind of survival games or just hardcore RPGs like Dark Souls - this mod can be really hard for you as it’s really realistic and most likely stared a new playthrough with its default settings you’ll die from cold more often then from enemies. But it’s not a reason not to use it if you like its idea in overall. Its MCM menu is really greatly customizable so you can decrease all negative effects power and increase your items/clothes values to play more simple.

        Awesome and light-weightbasic needs mod. It adds hunger/thirst/sleep system so finally food and drinks become valuable in your playthrough. It also offers intuitive system of widgets to inform you about current needs status. It’s very high-compatible with most popular mods and greatly customizable in MCM menu. It’s more immersive, has more features and have better design (Ninth bless widgets!) than Realistic Needs and Diseases in my opinion and also has much better compatibility with other mods, but if you like RnD more - install it instead.<br>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27693">Frostbite</a>
        As much as I personally love Frostfall, huge huge and complex it is, it's often becoming a big issue in heavy-modded setups because of being very, very script-heavy, plus it has more issues in SE than in LE version. That's why I humbly recommend you to look at this fresh, lightweight, highly compatible and constanly updated mod that can be considered a simplier and vastly more safe alternative to Frostfall.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16308">Vitality Mode - Basic Needs - Eat Drink and Sleep</a>

        One of another imemrsion kings and great cosmetic addon to survival mods themselves. Drips, soggy feet, breaths, rain blind, snow accumulation on clothes, speed reduction during blizzard and so on. But it’s also pretty script-heavy so if you already runnin heavy-modded game think carefully before using it. Also take a look at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11320">hood fix patch</a>, improved water drips <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19477">addon</a> and backpack tweaks <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20231">patch</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159">Even Better Quest Objectives</a>
        This mod enhances the quest descriptions in the vanilla game so that you have a clear sense of where your are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do besides looking at the quest markers. Let's face it - the quest descriptions were quite bad, not specifying where you are supposed to go by themselves, and forcing you to play with the quest markers on all the time. This affects nearly 250 quest objectives/descriptions, spanning over 160 quests, editing descriptions that were either really vague or didn't exist at all. 
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2475">Not So Fast - Main Quest</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4063">Birds and Flocks</a>
        Three similar yet different mods - they are adding various birds here in there - pigeons and crows in cities, seagulls in ports and at seashores, flying and singing birds and forests, bird nests and so on. Technically, you can use all 3 mods together - they complement each other very well. But I personally see that adding all 3 is just adding a bit too much in total, so I'm using Birds of Skyrim and SkyBirds, without Birds and Flocks - but that's just me.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7560">Wearable Lanterns</a>

        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22374">Skyrim Reputation</a>
        New and simply amazing, unique mod that adds ACTUAL reputation system to Skyrim - how townfolk, factions and other people react on you and talk to you, depending on how known (good or evil) your character is.

        This mod was not updated for a very long time, but it’s still working great. It adds dynamic muscle growth system.

        Mod adds a network of wayshrines across the world of Skyrim, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn that allows players to instantly travel from one wayshrine to another in a more lore-friendly way. The mod is balanced by forcing players to have to locate a wayshrine before they can gain access to its location for teleportation.

      <p>Better animations for movement, actions and fighting, and new animations.</p>
      <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <p class="text_yellow">First of all, let's grab some essential animations mods which will either serve as a solid improvement base that or as an element of controlling the new animations:</p>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1439">Realistic Ragdolls and Force</a>
        Simple as that.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4254">Immersive Animations</a>
        This mod can be considered an essential "vanilla animation +" mod - all animatons are still immersive and realistic, but much better than dull original animations. Install this mod as base - whatever other animation mods you will install later, they will just overwrite it, and those animations not covered will be still better than vanilla ones.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038">Fores New Idles in Skyrim - FNIS</a>
        Mod for custom animations. Absolutely must-have. Required for most of animation mods. Basic installation: -  FNIS Behavior SE - Install FNIS Creature Pack SE (optional,  necessary for creature animation mods) - install FNIS Spells SE (optional, necessary for the spells) - install FNIS Behavior SE add-on 3 (optional, needed only for AGO and TK Dodge compatibility). Good, you’ll need to do only 1 move to finish it, but it will be later.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13281">FNIS PCEA2 - Player Exclusive Animations (dynamic)</a>
        With this amazing mod you can simply switch between different animations for your character via MCM menu directly in game. Also it already has several great animation mods included. Just install and have fun!
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988">XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - XPMSSE</a>
        The one and only. King of skeleton mods. Install with mod manager. Everything is simple, I also strongly recommend to NOT install anything you are not aware of. Just do the basic installation and you’ll be fine. Do NOT overwrite XPMSE after this. Never. The ONLY currently "safe" case is Rougeshot meshes mods for creatures (if you already have them intsalled, simply do [not] overwrite them with XPMSE).<br>
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17763" style="display:inline;">Ecotone Dual Sheath</a> <span class="color_blue">[OR]</span> <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155" style="display:inline;">Dual Sheath Redux</a><br>
        Why can’t you see your left-hand weapon on you? Why can’t you have shield on back? Why can’t you see your staves on you? Think no more - install one of those!<br>
        Which one and what/why? Second one is well-known Skyrim LE mod that's not officially ported to SE and first one is a similar SE mod. The choice here is completely up to you, but I personally recommend to convert DSR (LE mod) to SE using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/79igji/guide_how_to_make_dual_sheath_redux_work_in/">this article</a>. The thing is, DSR, even while it's a converted LE mod, in the end works better and has less bugs than Ecotone, simple as that. But onece again, that's up to you. If using DSR, you can also convert this huge <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64647">collection of patches</a> for dozens of weapon mods and also take a look on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21040">patches here</a>.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5890">D13 Faster GET UP STAND UP animation vanilla friendly</a>
        Great balance mod - get up after being ragdolled by dragon, mammoth or other such enemy faster than in vanilla, but still not too fast. This mod is pretty much needed when playing with gameplay mods, as AI mods often make enemies more savage and/or give realistic attack impact physics to them, and playing with super long vanilla animation speed would simply lead to silly character demises too often.
        <p class="text_yellow">Good! Now let's see some other qualitative animation mods. This type of mods in general is always and absolutely a matter of taste, so I won't be recommending anything personally here - just list some qualitative/original looking mods, from which you can choose yourself :)</p>

        <p class="text_yellow text-center">Skyrim SE has much lower animation mods variety compared to Skyrim LE sadly. Almost all animation mods are ports of their respective LE version - that's why, even the most qualitative mods often have at least couple of minor bugs - yet nothing actually dangerous though. You can also port animations from LE to SE yourself using this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2970">tutorial</a>.</p>

      <p class="text_yellow text-center bold">THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SECTION, DO NOT SKIP IT</p>
      <p>Here comes some "final" mods and/or actions that you'll need. Due to how they are made or how they are working, you should deal with them after your mod list is more or less complete. DynDOLOD, ASIS, DSR and some other actions needed to finalize your setup. Let's set them up - the final push is now!</p>
      <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <p class="text_yellow">#1 - BUILD A BASHED PATCH</p>
        Run Wrye Bash ((if you don't have it or forgot why you need a Bashed Patch, return to stability section, step #8).<br>At the bottom, you'll see plugin called Bashed Patch, 0. Right-click on it and click on "Build Patch" option, click ok and build the patch. It will take some time. If the process will be interrupted with some errors popped in window - just disable the mod listed and build the patch again. This happens really rare, so most likely you won't even encounter that at. We'll run it again - for now it was needed to make sort of "ultra-easy-one-click-basic-merging" of some patches and tiny mods.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Can't build the bashed patch cuz you have more than 254 active plugins?</span> Simply disable as many last mods in load order as needed for the list to have less then 255 active plugins, and build the bashed patch. You can repeat this action several times to easily reduce amount of active plugins as much as possible before mergin them yourself.<br>
        If you will still have inactive plugins after this step (Wrye Bash merges only [some] mods, not all mods that can be merged), proceed to step two.
        <p class="text_yellow">#2 - MERGE YOUR MODS (optional, if you're still above 254 plugins)</p>
        Over 255 active plugins limit? Worry not! If you don't have Merge Plugins or forgot why you need a to merge mods, return to stability section, step #9.<br>It's not hard at all - just do it slowly. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KTT58qLaUIo">this video</a> for "fast yet enough" instructions or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S6cpCwTezE">this video</a> for more in-depth turorial.<br>Our main task now is to get amount of plugins to 254 or lower. Merging process itself is very easy and the main issue is to know which mods you can actually merge. Until you are building a super-heavy mod list (with like 700+ mods), you can you the next simple instructions which can consider&nbsp;"a simple steps for easy merging":<br>1) You can ofc merge everything possible into a single .esp, but that's not recommended. Try to merge the mods of same "common" category. For example, merge weapons &amp; armors mods in one merged .esp. patches into second and various other small gameplay mods in third one.<br>2) Follow the "Rule Of Four". Just grab some mods you want to merge and see if:<br>- All mods you wanna merge are not directly conflicting (between themselves, conflicts with base game .esm and dlcs is fine), using the xEdit option showed on this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/A5iN5w2.png">screenshot</a>.<br>- All mods you wanna merge do NOT have .bsa archives.<br>- All mods you wanna merge do NOT have MCM.<br>- All mods you wanna merge do NOT have navmesh records (the records showed on this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yDECMzO.png">screenshot</a>).<br>If answer to all 4 questions is "NO" - you can easily merge these mods in a few clicks using Merge Plugins basic functionality. If some mods don't fit the "rule", just leave exclude them from to-merge list. Oh, and NEVER merge .ESM plugins.<br>And now, the exciting detail! Remember the&nbsp;<img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/7p2BG8F.png">﻿indicators? This indicator means that #2, #3 and #4 in "rule of four" you don't need to check for this mod already - only check the mods for conflicts in SSEEdit and add them to the merge :)<br>3) Repeat this until you have as many mods to merge as possible and make the merge. Remember that in rare cases MP will show you errors in some mods, that doesn't mean crashes - you can ignore them to add this mod to merge as well, as showed on this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/L0oOPWJ.png">screenshot</a>.<br>4) Remember that you can merge merged .esp plugins as well - as many times as you wannna - so better do everything slowly, step by step, merging mods by tens or so - don't try to merge 100 mods in on fell swoop if you're doing this first time :)<br>5) Merge mods until your amount of plugins will be less than 250.&nbsp;Profit!<br><font color="#6fa8dc">Note</font>: in fact, both mods with .bsa archives and navmesh records [can] be merged - "rule of four" is just the most "simple-to-go" one, which you can use as a "base" for merging without any additional actions required. This said, merging both mods with navmesh records or .bsa archives is not technically hard at all - in first case you just need to rebuild navmeshes in CK and in second case you can just unpack the .bsa for respective mods using <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ua0T3jx.png">this</a> option in Merge Plugins. Such details are coming with experience and you should not be afraid of them - and you can always be sure that the guide provides you with all needed "first steps" for modding experience. For more in-depth but easy-to-swallow tips and tricks for making more "hard" merges, check out this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13608/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=6250576">tasty tutorial</a> from ETAC authoress.
        <p class="text_yellow">#3 - REBUILD &amp; TWEAK YOUR BASHED PATCH</p>
        Run Wrye Bash and rebuild your Bashed patch, same as you did in step one.<br>
        <!--Open the Bashed Patch, 0 in SSEEdit and delete all records that are not leveled-related, like shown on <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vlHBc3m.png">this picture</a>. Bashed Patch is doing leveled lists records better than Merged Patch (the next step).<br>Now, as many records were delete, Bashed Patch most likely will have several master files listed, but not needed. Right click on the Bashed Patch, 0 in SSEEdit and click on "Clean Masters" option as shown on <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1v1722w.png">this picture</a>. Close and save when asked.-->
        <p class="text_yellow">#4 - MAKE A MERGED PATCH</p>
        Run SSEEdit (if you don't have it or forgot why you need a Merged Patch, return to stability section, step #7).<br>Now, watch the part of&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/j5Tw3t2MvaU?t=285">this video</a>. Link is with timing, but just in case, you need to start watching from 4:45.<br>
        After it's generated, open it and delete leveled records (also shown in the video). If you're using NMM, watch till 6:41, if you're using MO, watch till 7:01. Deleting the leveled records is needed as Bashed Patch that we made in previous step, handles this a bit better. Don't forget to clean unneeded masters, same as we just made for Bashed Patch.<br>
        <p>
          <span class="note_pink">Q:</span> why not to use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90987">Smashed Patch</a> instead? It's said this tool is doing everything both Bashed and Merged patch are doing in terms of conflicts, but just better. So?<br>
          <span class="color_blue">A:</span> Mator Smash is indeed an amazing work! And indeed, if often covers more conflicting records merging then Bashed or Merged patch do, so if you're using Smashed Patch, you don't need neither Bashed or Merged. But the thing is, whatever its algorithm is, it's doing those records merging pretty "wild" - often inaccurate, which can lead to various issues, from just weird ones, like double merchant stock, to more serious ones, like visible ingame bugs and crashes. No automated tool is perfect (Bashed and Merged too), but atm, Smashed Patch is just working too much inaccurate which can sometimes bring you more headache then good results. If you wanna use it instead of Bashed/Merged combination, you're free too, but keep in mind to always check the Smashed Patch yourself manually after building it, and make a deep ingame test. Once again, this is a great tool with a lot of efforts put into it, but I simpyl can't directly recommend or disrecommend it. Use at your own preference.
        </p>
        <p class="text_yellow">#5 - RUN FNIS, ASIS &amp; DSR PATCHES (if using them)</p>
        - ASIS patcher is file named "ASIS.jar" in <span class="color_blue">\Data\SkyProc Patchers\ASIS</span>. Remember to [not] use anything besides perks, spells and potions. Click on "Patch" and wait unti it's finished, it can take couple of minutes. Remember to run patcher each time you've installed mods that add/change NPCs, perks or spells. You can also just make a shortcut of "ASIS.jar" to your desktop to same time in future.<br>
        - DSR patcher is file named "Dual Sheath Redux Patch.jar" in <span class="color_blue">\Data\SkyProc Patchers\Dual Sheath Redux Patch</span>. Just run the file, click on "Patch" and wait unti it's finished, it can take few of minutes (usually longer than ASIS). Remember to run patcher each time you've installed mods that add/change weapons/armors. You can also just make a shortcut of "Dual Sheath Redux Patch.jar" to your desktop to same time in future.<br>
        - FNIS patcher is file named "GenerateFNISforUsers.exe" in <span class="color_blue">\Data\tools\GenerateFNIS_for_Users</span>. Run the file, choose essential patches in the list of options in lower part of window ("Gender Specifif Animations" and "Skeleton Arm Fix"), optional patches if needed and click on "Update FNIS Behavior". Wait until it's finished (usually it takes just a few seconds), close the window and click on "Yes" when asked (this will simply add a shortcut of patcher at your desktop). Make sure to run patcher each time you installed mods that are affecting animations.

        <p class="text_yellow" style="margin-top:0;">#6 - MAKE YOUR DISTANT OBJECTS BEAUTIFUL AS NEVER BEFORE</p>
        What is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721">DynDOLOD</a>? It's a constantly updated, awesome and great, revolutionary, in some sense - but needs some time to install and use. Its a successor of Tes5LodGen, which is basically generating the LODs (optimized textures of distant objects far from you - trees, buildings, light sournces, glowing windows etc). Vanilla Skyrim LODs just sucks. For example, somewhere far infront of you (you know that let's say) there are 200 trees. But game engine will load 10 LODs as maximum - and so, distant view will look bald, and when you'll come closer - all the rest 190 trees will just instantly pop-up out of nowhere. Annoying, isn't it?<br>
        Secondly, neither Skyrim engine and Tes5LodGen were able to generate LODs for mods. DynDOLOD can! Yes, yes, yes - that's what you're thinking about. If let's say you installed a mod that adds new houses near village - you will see these houses LODs in distance. If mod places new trees - you will see them all. If you're playing some kind of new land mod - even here, LODs will be generated.<br>
        DynDOLOD even has 3D-LODs option for trees! This literally means LODs can be generated in 3D-like look with greater quality and with meshes (LOD don't have models by default, only flat textures, that's why even while being dense, they still noticably differ from actual rendered trees) so you won't actaully notice the transition between regular objects textures and LODs, making exploraton almost seamless.<br>
        That's what DynDOLOD about - it's absolutely essential mod that will drastically improve how your worldscape look.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">But the link leads to Skyrim LE mod! Will it work fine?</span> Yes, DynDOLOD officially supports Skyrim SE, just the SE file version is hosted on LE page still, simple as that.<br><br>
        <span class="text_yellow">Absolutely simplified installation of Dyndolod looks like this:</span>
        <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
        <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
          1) Installing DynDOLOD required mods.<br>
          2) Installing DynDOLOD core files, namely the "DynDOLOD Resource SE" via mod manager.<br>
          3) Downloading the DynDOLOD files (archive with generators .exe) themselves, namely the "DynDOLOD" file, manually and unpacking it anywhere you want.<br>
          4) Installing billboards in the same order you installed trees/landscape mod (i.e. if you have tree mods A, B, C, you should install billboards for mod A, then for mod B, then for mod C, and overwrite). Note - vanilla Skyrim billboards you can get from TES5LodGen Files tab (Skyrim LE mod) - they are same for LE/SE.<br>
          5) Installing patches via mod manager.<br>
          6) Generating textures via texgen.exe, archiving them, dropping to your mod manager mods folder, installing via mod manager. Make sure you're running DynDOLOD .exe files for SE, as described <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6hoR8fC.png">here</a>.<br>
          7) Making sure no antivirus is running, or adding DynDOLOLD executable to its whitelist. Disabling ASIS, DSR/Ecotone, Cutting Room Floor, Bashed/Merged Patch, Skybirds .esp plugins (if you have them) before running the generator executable.<br>
          8) Generating dyndolod via dyndolod.exe (running it as admin), archiving the files, dropping to your mod manager mods folder, installing via mod manager.<br>
          9) Activating dyndoldod .esp plugin and plugins you disabled (if) in step 6.<br>
          10) Profit :3<br>
        </div><br>
        Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/1_5MWqeHIzw">this</a> awesome guide if installation still looks complicated for you.<br>
        To make some lods even more detailed, you can use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3333">this</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9135">this</a> great mods alongside DynDOLOD (install before generating).<br>
        I also highly recommending <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23585">this</a> great distant "noise" (distant terrain) texture replacer for best possible blending. If you're getting "lighting bulb glitch" no matter what, try <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27692">this</a> fix.<br>
        For 3D LODs instructions (they are actually more then simple), read the "3d lods help.txt" tutorial inside the main <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76086?tab=files">EVT file archive</a>. I'll make a video tutorial for 3D LODs a bit later on my YT channel.<br>
        <span class="note_pink">Note:</span> 3D LODs can eat some FPS depending on your PC specs.
        <p class="text_yellow">#7 - THAT'S IT! YOU CAN START PLAYING!</p>

      <p>You rig is pretty old, but you still want somehow to run ENB and some graphics mods? Don't worry, that's more then possible! Please take into account that "low-end" is pretty wide term, so here I will just put all possible advices and tricks that may help you. You can also refer to this section even if your PC is strong - to get more FPS for different purposes.</p>
      <input type="button" class="spoiler" value="Show">
      <div class="spoiler_wrapper"><br>
        <p class="text_yellow text-center bold">Have too weak rig but still wanna have some of those tasty graphics mods? Have a strong rig, but need to gain a few FPS? Look here!</p>
        <div class="center_img"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb93vpqQ4s1rucc9wo6_r1_500.gif" alt=""></div>
        <p class="text_yellow">1) Open SkyrimPrefs.ini and find <span class="color_blue">iShadowMapResolution=</span> value</p>
        It's usually set to 4096. Change this value to 2048 or even to 1024. Save the changes, close the .ini file. Changing it to 2048 will make almost zero visual quality loss for shadows, but give you 5-8 FPS boost depending on your PC specs and mod list. Changing it to 1024 will ofc make shadows looks worse, but can sometimes give up to 10-15 FPS. One-click boost!
        <p class="text_yellow">2) Use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21166">performance optimized textures for SSE</a></p>
        Skyrim SE texture are mostly in 2k resolution. This mod has 2 versions with 1k and ever 512 textures resolution.
        <p class="text_yellow">3) Use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12801">Ordenator</a></p>
        Simple as that. Still bad FPS? Just use this amazing tool to optimize textures minmaps and compress ALL your textures to 1024 or even 512. Make sure to use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88817">this</a> .ini file. You can also read <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71294">this</a> tutorial for it.
        <p class="text_yellow">4) My PC can't afford DynDOLOD and ENB DOF, but I don't want to see these ugly LODs! What can I do?</p>
        Use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15366">DYNAVISION</a> which gives simple DOF with literally 0 FPS hit.
        <p class="text_yellow">5) <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26625">Use Paramount - FPS and Fixes Galore</a></p>
        New and absolutely amazing mod for low-end rig. It Optimizes texture resolution for dozens common object types in the game and removes various minor, not much needed effects and tiny objects - you most likely won't ever notice that, but have a good performance boost. It also comes with handy FOMOD isntaller, so you can choose all options you want and don't want yourself.
        <p class="text_yellow">6) Still bad FPS in cities?</p>
        Use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18768">No grass in Cities</a>.
        <p class="text_yellow">7) Lower you ingame resolution</p>
        For example, if you have FullHD monitor (1920x1080), set ingame resolution to 1280x720. While ofc playing on lwoer resolution is not what you may want, but it's not very noticable after you play a bit, but even downscale from 1080p to 720p can give you 10-20 FPS - which you can use to run ENB and/or run DynDOLOD on low settings, and this benefit definitely overlaps the resolution disadvantage.
        <p class="text_yellow">8) Mod <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/skyrim_graphics.html">Skyrim LE</a>.</p>
        What? How? You may ask. The thing, is, Skyrim SE by itself require much better PC to run the game itself then original Skyrim, so if your have really weak rig which struggles with performance even with the game itself on ultra settings, or with nimimal graphics mods setup, modding LE is a direct way for you - LE itself requires much less resources than SE initially, and can be optimized much better than SE. Even more - for example, there was a person in our community who was able to run Skyrim with ENB (low-end ENB preset, ofc, but still a real ENB) and some graphics mods on GTX 285! This GPU, as you can guess, won't even handle Skyrim SE itself without mods normally, but in LE, player was able to run simple ENB and so achieve much better graphics than he would get in SE. You got the point. My Skyrim LE guide also has low-end section with even more tips.

      <div class="center_img"><img src="./Skyrim SE Ultimate Modding Guide - All In One_files/vxtH2ho.png" alt=""></div>
      <p>If you don't want to go trough the whole list yourself and think about which mods and how to combine, or just don't have time - this section is what you need! Below you can find several "plug and play" mod lists that I personally compiled - so you don't have to worry about testing mods, finding which play well together and which not  - don't have to worry about compatibility at all. Just choose the mod list that you like the most, by reading its description - and then simply mimic it in no time. Playing modded Skyrim (or Skyrim at all) first time? Wanna have casual combat and be OP? Hardcore combat and survival? Lightweight mod list with "vanilla plus" experience or super-heavy mod list where each tiniest details is improved? Modules section has a mod list for any preference. Modules can also list certain ENB presets that I see "fitting" the mod list purpose in general and have certain advices about graphics mods in general - but these recommendations is just a cosmetical advice.</p>
      <p><span class="note_pink">Important note #1:</span> each of modules assumes you already implemented Stability and Graphics parts of the guide. While graphics part is ofc totally up to you (and depends on your PC capabilities), make 200% sure you've implemented whole Stability section as it's an essential one, no matter how big mod list you are planning to have. I won't be able to provide any troubleshooting if you didn't make the Stability part. Implement it.</p>
      <p><span class="note_pink">Important note #2:</span> some of the mod lists names may be hinting their setup, some no - mostly I just picked the names I wanted and that's it. Name of the mod list can be purely cosmetic at all. So make sure to read each module description, besides the name.</p>
      <p><span class="note_pink">Important note #3:</span> after you mimic the mod list (any of it), proceed to the "Mods to be installed or actions to be made in the end of modding process" section.<br>
      To choose your mod list, look below ↓↓↓</p>

        This module is a perfect mod list if you're playing Skyrim for the first time at all. Any TES game is an immensely huge, many times bigger than any other game of similar type - and it's an unspoken canon to first time play game without changing it by mods. First of all, if you'll install a lot of mods to your first walkthrough - you will be simply lost in amount of features, spells, items, quests and so on - because you won't have experience of original game. Secondly, playing with original functionality will help you to see how insane is the difference between vanilla and modded game.<br>
        This mod list is small and will not change any game mechanics drastically, but fix bugs or just plainly boring/silly vanilla mechanics, and add some content here and there - but in absolutely non-intrusive way. It will be still the vanilla Skyrim experience, just better.

      <p>The Winking Skeever module is perfect for those who already played Skyrim and/or other TES games, and maybe even played with mods here and there, but still, never had a heavy-modded experience and not quite sure about own goals in terms of gameplay, or just played the game few years ago. Module will provide you with not only needed bugfixes and improvements, but also make add enough content &amp; new mechanics, and make gameplay much more challenging and fun, without making it hardcore or adding too much new content - you will feel the game refreshed as much as not to become lost in new content. Just as much enough of everything to have a good "tease" of modded Skyrim yet with very fast modding process.</p>

        <p>Good! Now proceed to the "Mods to be installed or actions to be made in the end of modding process" section. Required steps are #1, #3 and #4. Step #6 (DynDOLOD) is optional - it will make your game distant objects absolutely beautiful, but it requires some time to read about the installation, so decide yourself. Also, if you're owner of a windescreen monitor, install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778">fix</a> and take a look ad low-end section of the guide if you have weak rig or just need to gain a few FPS. After you've finished these steps, just sort your load order with LOOT and you're ready to go.</p>

Also, if you're owner of a windescreen monitor, install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778">fix</a> and take a look ad low-end section of the guide if you have weak rig or just need to gain a few FPS.

      <p>Drunken Huntsman is a "golden middle" in terms of heavy-modded game. It's already a pretty heavy mod list that's making gameplay not only expanded, but greatly challening. It also adds much more new content as well as new gameplay features in each modding category. It's a mod list for those who already played with mods for some time and want "advance to the next level" and build their first really heavy-modded game - but, it's also not "that" huge to become ovewhelming in terms of both gameplay or modlist building process itself. Take into account that this module will make your game much harder - but also much more rewarding.</p>

        Which one and what/why? Second one is well-known Skyrim LE mod that's not officially ported to SE and first one is a similar SE mod. The choice here is completely up to you, but I personally recommend to convert DSR (LE mod) to SE using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/79igji/guide_how_to_make_dual_sheath_redux_work_in/">this article</a>. The thing is, DSR, even while it's a converted LE mod, in the end works better and has less bugs than Ecotone, simple as that. But onece again, that's up to you. If using DSR, you can also convert this huge <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64647">collection of patches</a> for dozens of weapon mods.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802">Legacy of the Dragonborn</a>
        Insatll the main file and the update file. Then download and run the "Legacy of the Dragonborn Patches SE" patches installer. It should automatically detect all needed mods you have, but still, read the options carefully yourself. Finally, install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17057">this</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16080">this</a>.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18369">QUASIPC</a>
        Just download and install. Installer will auotmatically detect your mods and isntall some needed patches.

        Same here.
        <a class="mod_name" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20166">Classic Sprinting Redone</a>
        This mod installation is optional.
        <p>Good! Now proceed to the "Mods to be installed or actions to be made in the end of modding process" section and follow the steps in it. Also, if you're owner of a windescreen monitor, install this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778">fix</a> and take a look ad low-end section of the guide if you have weak rig or just need to gain a few FPS. After you've finished these steps, just sort your load order with LOOT and you're ready to go.</p>

      <p>A true hero of Skyrim. A protector of the realm. This module is the ultimate setup of mods - basically, very close to what I'm using myself. If you're a veteran Skyrim player and have decent modded walkthrough experience (or just crazy enough ^,,^), if you remember all its details and want dozens of new stories &amp; adventures, if you want your gameplay to be incredibly challenging yet incredibly rewarding, if you want the each smallest, tiniest, microscopic detail of Skyrim gameplay to be improved, and bug/overlook - fixed, together with a lot of cool new features and mechanics, if you want nextgen, "devil in details" mod list that will surprise you on each step no matter how many hours (or thousands) or hours you have in this series - Fatherland Saviour is waiting. This mod list also contains not only general instructions, but also all needed tweaks, till the smallest ones, in mods MCMs, together with my own edits in many cases.</p>
